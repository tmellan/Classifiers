octagon room at Sir Robert Chiltern\[CloseCurlyQuote]s house in Grosvenor \
Square_.\\n\\n[_The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_.  _At the \
top of\\nthe staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek \
beauty_,\\n_about twenty-seven years of age_.  _She receives the guests as \
they come\\nup_.  _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier \
with wax\\nlights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century \
French\\ntapestry\[LongDash]representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design \
by\\nBoucher\[LongDash]that is stretched on the staircase wall_.  _On the \
right is the\\nentrance to the music-room_.  _The sound of a string quartette \
is faintly\\nheard_.  _The entrance on the left leads to other \
reception-rooms_.  MRS.\\nMARCHMONT _and_ LADY BASILDON, _two very pretty \
women_, _are seated\\ntogether on a Louis Seize sofa_.  _They are types of \
exquisite\\nfragility_.  _Their affectation of manner has a delicate \
charm_.\\n_Watteau would have loved to paint them_.]\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  \
Going on to the Hartlocks\[CloseCurlyQuote] to-night, Margaret?\\n\\nLADY \
BASILDON.  I suppose so.  Are you?\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  Yes.  Horribly \
tedious parties they give, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t they?\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  \
Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I\\ngo \
anywhere.\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  I come here to be educated.\\n\\nLADY \
BASILDON.  Ah! I hate being educated!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  So do I.  It puts \
one almost on a level with the\\ncommercial classes, doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always\\ntelling me that I should have \
some serious purpose in life.  So I come\\nhere to try to find one.\\n\\nLADY \
BASILDON.  [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
see\\nanybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious \
purpose.\\nThe man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the \
whole\\ntime.\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  How very trivial of him!\\n\\nLADY \
BASILDON.  Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?\\n\\nMRS. \
MARCHMONT.  About myself.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  [_Languidly_.]  And were you \
interested?\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Shaking her head_.]  Not in the smallest \
degree.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!\\n\\nMRS. \
MARCHMONT.  [_Rising_.]  And how well it becomes us, Olivia!\\n\\n[_They rise \
and go towards the music-room_.  _The_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC, _a\\nyoung attach\
\[EAcute] known for his neckties and his Anglomania_, _approaches\\nwith a \
low bow_, _and enters into conversation_.]\\n\\nMASON.  [_Announcing guests \
from the top of the staircase_.]  Mr. and\\nLady Jane Barford.  Lord \
Caversham.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM, _an old gentleman of seventy_, \
_wearing the\\nriband and star of the Garter_.  _A fine Whig type_.  _Rather \
like a\\nportrait by Lawrence_.]\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Good evening, Lady \
Chiltern!  Has my good-for-nothing\\nyoung son been here?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN. \
 [_Smiling_.]  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.\\n\
\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_Coming up to_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]  Why do you call \
Lord\\nGoring good-for-nothing?\\n\\n[MABEL CHILTERN _is a perfect example of \
the English type of prettiness_,\\n_the apple-blossom type_.  _She has all \
the fragrance and freedom of a\\nflower_.  _There is ripple after ripple of \
sunlight in her hair_, _and\\nthe little mouth_, _with its parted lips_, _is \
expectant_, _like the\\nmouth of a child_.  _She has the fascinating tyranny \
of youth_, _and the\\nastonishing courage of innocence_.  _To sane people she \
is not\\nreminiscent of any work of art_.  _But she is really like a \
Tanagra\\nstatuette_, _and would be rather annoyed if she were told \
so_.]\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Because he leads such an idle life.\\n\\nMABEL \
CHILTERN.  How can you say such a thing?  Why, he rides in the Row\\nat ten o\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week,\
\\nchanges his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every \
night\\nof the season.  You don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t call that leading an idle \
life, do you?\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Looking at her with a kindly twinkle in \
his eyes_.]\\nYou are a very charming young lady!\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  How \
sweet of you to say that, Lord Caversham!  Do come\\nto us more often.  You \
know we are always at home on Wednesdays, and you\\nlook so well with your \
star!\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Never go anywhere now.  Sick of London \
Society.\\nShouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mind being introduced to my own tailor; \
he always votes on the\\nright side.  But object strongly to being sent down \
to dinner with my\\nwife\[CloseCurlyQuote]s milliner.  Never could stand Lady \
Caversham\[CloseCurlyQuote]s bonnets.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Oh, I love London \
Society!  I think it has immensely\\nimproved.  It is entirely composed now \
of beautiful idiots and brilliant\\nlunatics.  Just what Society should \
be.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Hum!  Which is Goring?  Beautiful idiot, or the \
other\\nthing?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_Gravely_.]  I have been obliged for \
the present to put\\nLord Goring into a class quite by himself.  But he is \
developing\\ncharmingly!\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Into what?\\n\\nMABEL \
CHILTERN.  [_With a little curtsey_.]  I hope to let you know very\\nsoon, \
Lord Caversham!\\n\\nMASON.  [_Announcing guests_.]  Lady Markby.  Mrs. \
Cheveley.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LADY MARKBY _and_ MRS. CHEVELEY.  LADY MARKBY _is a \
pleasant_,\\n_kindly_, _popular woman_, _with gray hair \[AGrave] la marquise \
and good lace_.\\nMRS. CHEVELEY, _who accompanies her_, _is tall and rather \
slight_.  _Lips\\nvery thin and highly-coloured_, _a line of scarlet on a \
pallid face_.\\n_Venetian red hair_, _aquiline nose_, _and long throat_.  \
_Rouge\\naccentuates the natural paleness of her complexion_.  _Gray-green \
eyes\\nthat move restlessly_.  _She is in heliotrope_, _with diamonds_.  _She\
\\nlooks rather like an orchid_, _and makes great demands on one\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\ncuriosity_.  _In all her movements she is extremely \
graceful_.  _A work\\nof art_, _on the whole_, _but showing the influence of \
too many\\nschools_.]\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Good evening, dear Gertrude!  So \
kind of you to let me\\nbring my friend, Mrs. Cheveley.  Two such charming \
women should know each\\nother!\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Advances towards_ MRS. \
CHEVELEY _with a sweet smile_.\\n_Then suddenly stops_, _and bows rather \
distantly_.]  I think Mrs.\\nCheveley and I have met before.  I did not know \
she had married a second\\ntime.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  [_Genially_.]  Ah, \
nowadays people marry as often as they\\ncan, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t they?  \
It is most fashionable.  [_To_ DUCHESS OF MARYBOROUGH.]\\nDear Duchess, and \
how is the Duke?  Brain still weak, I suppose?  Well,\\nthat is only to be \
expected, is it not?  His good father was just the\\nsame.  There is nothing \
like race, is there?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Playing with her fan_.]  But have \
we really met before,\\nLady Chiltern?  I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t remember \
where.  I have been out of England for\\nso long.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  We \
were at school together, Mrs. Cheveley.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY \
[_Superciliously_.]  Indeed?  I have forgotten all about my\\nschooldays.  I \
have a vague impression that they were detestable.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  \
[_Coldly_.]  I am not surprised!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_In her sweetest \
manner_.]  Do you know, I am quite\\nlooking forward to meeting your clever \
husband, Lady Chiltern.  Since he\\nhas been at the Foreign Office, he has \
been so much talked of in Vienna.\\nThey actually succeed in spelling his \
name right in the newspapers.  That\\nin itself is fame, on the continent.\\n\
\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I hardly think there will be much in common between \
you\\nand my husband, Mrs. Cheveley!  [_Moves away_.]\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC. \
 Ah! ch\[EGrave]re Madame, queue surprise!  I have not seen\\nyou since \
Berlin!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Not since Berlin, Vicomte.  Five years \
ago!\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  And you are younger and more beautiful than \
ever.\\nHow do you manage it?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  By making it a rule only \
to talk to perfectly charming\\npeople like yourself.\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC. \
 Ah! you flatter me.  You butter me, as they say here.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
Do they say that here?  How dreadful of them!\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  Yes, \
they have a wonderful language.  It should be\\nmore widely known.\\n\\n[SIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN _enters_.  _A man of forty_, _but looking \
somewhat\\nyounger_.  _Clean-shaven_, _with finely-cut features_, \
_dark-haired and\\ndark-eyed_.  _A personality of mark_.  _Not popular\
\[LongDash]few personalities\\nare_.  _But intensely admired by the few_, \
_and deeply respected by the\\nmany_.  _The note of his manner is that of \
perfect distinction_, _with a\\nslight touch of pride_.  _One feels that he \
is conscious of the success\\nhe has made in life_.  _A nervous temperament_, \
_with a tired look_.\\n_The firmly-chiselled mouth and chin contrast \
strikingly with the\\nromantic expression in the deep-set eyes_.  _The \
variance is suggestive\\nof an almost complete separation of passion and \
intellect_, _as though\\nthought and emotion were each isolated in its own \
sphere through some\\nviolence of will-power_.  _There is nervousness in the \
nostrils_, _and in\\nthe pale_, _thin_, _pointed hands_.  _It would be \
inaccurate to call him\\npicturesque_.  _Picturesqueness cannot survive the \
House of Commons_.\\n_But Vandyck would have liked to have painted his \
head_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Good evening, Lady Markby!  I hope you \
have brought\\nSir John with you?\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Oh! I have brought a \
much more charming person than Sir\\nJohn.  Sir John\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
temper since he has taken seriously to politics has\\nbecome quite \
unbearable.  Really, now that the House of Commons is trying\\nto become \
useful, it does a great deal of harm.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I hope not, \
Lady Markby.  At any rate we do our\\nbest to waste the public time, don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t we?  But who is this charming person\\nyou have been kind \
enough to bring to us?\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Her name is Mrs. Cheveley!  One of \
the Dorsetshire\\nCheveleys, I suppose.  But I really don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
know.  Families are so mixed\\nnowadays.  Indeed, as a rule, everybody turns \
out to be somebody else.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Mrs. Cheveley?  I seem to \
know the name.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  She has just arrived from Vienna.\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  Ah! yes.  I think I know whom you mean.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  \
Oh! she goes everywhere there, and has such pleasant\\nscandals about all her \
friends.  I really must go to Vienna next winter.\\nI hope there is a good \
chef at the Embassy.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  If there is not, the \
Ambassador will certainly have\\nto be recalled.  Pray point out Mrs. \
Cheveley to me.  I should like to\\nsee her.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Let me \
introduce you.  [_To_ MRS. CHEVELEY.]  My dear, Sir\\nRobert Chiltern is \
dying to know you!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Bowing_.]  Every one is dying \
to know the\\nbrilliant Mrs. Cheveley.  Our attach\[EAcute]s at Vienna write \
to us about\\nnothing else.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Thank you, Sir Robert.  An \
acquaintance that begins with\\na compliment is sure to develop into a real \
friendship.  It starts in the\\nright manner.  And I find that I know Lady \
Chiltern already.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Really?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
Yes.  She has just reminded me that we were at school\\ntogether.  I remember \
it perfectly now.  She always got the good conduct\\nprize.  I have a \
distinct recollection of Lady Chiltern always getting\\nthe good conduct \
prize!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Smiling_.]  And what prizes did you get, \
Mrs.\\nCheveley?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  My prizes came a little later on in \
life.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think\\nany of them were for good conduct.  I \
forget!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am sure they were for something \
charming!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know that women are \
always rewarded for being\\ncharming.  I think they are usually punished for \
it!  Certainly, more\\nwomen grow old nowadays through the faithfulness of \
their admirers than\\nthrough anything else!  At least that is the only way I \
can account for\\nthe terribly haggard look of most of your pretty women in \
London!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What an appalling philosophy that sounds!  \
To\\nattempt to classify you, Mrs. Cheveley, would be an impertinence.  \
But\\nmay I ask, at heart, are you an optimist or a pessimist?  Those seem to\
\\nbe the only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays.\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  Oh, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m neither.  Optimism begins in a broad \
grin, and\\nPessimism ends with blue spectacles.  Besides, they are both of \
them\\nmerely poses.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You prefer to be \
natural?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Sometimes.  But it is such a very difficult \
pose to keep\\nup.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What would those modern \
psychological novelists, of\\nwhom we hear so much, say to such a theory as \
that?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Ah! the strength of women comes from the fact that\
\\npsychology cannot explain us.  Men can be analysed, women . . . \
merely\\nadored.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You think science cannot grapple \
with the problem\\nof women?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Science can never grapple \
with the irrational.  That is\\nwhy it has no future before it, in this \
world.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And women represent the \
irrational.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Well-dressed women do.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  [_With a polite bow_.]  I fear I could hardly agree\\nwith you \
there.  But do sit down.  And now tell me, what makes you leave\\nyour \
brilliant Vienna for our gloomy London\[LongDash]or perhaps the question \
is\\nindiscreet?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Questions are never indiscreet.  \
Answers sometimes are.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Well, at any rate, may I \
know if it is politics or\\npleasure?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Politics are my \
only pleasure.  You see nowadays it is\\nnot fashionable to flirt till one is \
forty, or to be romantic till one is\\nforty-five, so we poor women who are \
under thirty, or say we are, have\\nnothing open to us but politics or \
philanthropy.  And philanthropy seems\\nto me to have become simply the \
refuge of people who wish to annoy their\\nfellow-creatures.  I prefer \
politics.  I think they are more . . .\\nbecoming!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
A political life is a noble career!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Sometimes.  And \
sometimes it is a clever game, Sir\\nRobert.  And sometimes it is a great \
nuisance.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Which do you find it?\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  I?  A combination of all three.  [_Drops her fan_.]\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Picks up fan_.]  Allow me!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
Thanks.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  But you have not told me yet what makes \
you honour\\nLondon so suddenly.  Our season is almost over.\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  Oh! I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t care about the London season!  It is \
too\\nmatrimonial.  People are either hunting for husbands, or hiding \
from\\nthem.  I wanted to meet you.  It is quite true.  You know what a woman\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\ncuriosity is.  Almost as great as a man\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s!  I wanted immensely to meet\\nyou, and . . . to ask you \
to do something for me.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I hope it is not a little \
thing, Mrs. Cheveley.  I\\nfind that little things are so very difficult to \
do.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_After a moment\[CloseCurlyQuote]s reflection_.]  \
No, I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think it is\\nquite a little thing.\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am so glad.  Do tell me what it is.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
Later on.  [_Rises_.]  And now may I walk through your\\nbeautiful house?  I \
hear your pictures are charming.  Poor Baron\\nArnheim\[LongDash]you remember \
the Baron?\[LongDash]used to tell me you had some \
wonderful\\nCorots.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With an almost imperceptible \
start_.]  Did you\\nknow Baron Arnheim well?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
[_Smiling_.]  Intimately.  Did you?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  At one \
time.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Wonderful man, wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
he?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_After a pause_.]  He was very remarkable, in \
many\\nways.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I often think it such a pity he never wrote \
his memoirs.\\nThey would have been most interesting.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  Yes: he knew men and cities well, like the old\\nGreek.\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  Without the dreadful disadvantage of having a Penelope\\nwaiting \
at home for him.\\n\\nMASON.  Lord Goring.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD GORING.  \
_Thirty-four_, _but always says he is younger_.\\n_A well-bred_, \
_expressionless face_.  _He is clever_, _but would not\\nlike to be thought \
so_.  _A flawless dandy_, _he would be annoyed if he\\nwere considered \
romantic_.  _He plays with life_, _and is on perfectly\\ngood terms with the \
world_.  _He is fond of being misunderstood_.  _It\\ngives him a post of \
vantage_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Good evening, my dear Arthur!  Mrs. \
Cheveley, allow\\nme to introduce to you Lord Goring, the idlest man in \
London.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I have met Lord Goring before.\\n\\nLORD GORING. \
 [_Bowing_.]  I did not think you would remember me, \
Mrs.\\nCheveley.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  My memory is under admirable control.  \
And are you still\\na bachelor?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I . . . believe \
so.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  How very romantic!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Oh! I am not \
at all romantic.  I am not old enough.  I\\nleave romance to my \
seniors.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Lord Goring is the result of Boodle\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Club, Mrs.\\nCheveley.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  He reflects \
every credit on the institution.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  May I ask are you staying \
in London long?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  That depends partly on the weather, \
partly on the\\ncooking, and partly on Sir Robert.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
You are not going to plunge us into a European war,\\nI hope?\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  There is no danger, at present!\\n\\n[_She nods to_ LORD GORING, \
_with a look of amusement in her eyes_, _and\\ngoes out with_ SIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  LORD GORING _saunters over to_ MABEL\\nCHILTERN.]\\n\\nMABEL \
CHILTERN.  You are very late!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Have you missed \
me?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Awfully!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Then I am sorry I did \
not stay away longer.  I like being\\nmissed.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  How very \
selfish of you!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I am very selfish.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  \
You are always telling me of your bad qualities, Lord\\nGoring.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  I have only told you half of them as yet, Miss Mabel!\\n\\nMABEL \
CHILTERN.  Are the others very bad?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Quite dreadful!  When \
I think of them at night I go to\\nsleep at once.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Well, \
I delight in your bad qualities.  I wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have\\nyou part \
with one of them.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  How very nice of you!  But then you are \
always nice.  By\\nthe way, I want to ask you a question, Miss Mabel.  Who \
brought Mrs.\\nCheveley here?  That woman in heliotrope, who has just gone \
out of the\\nroom with your brother?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Oh, I think Lady \
Markby brought her.  Why do you ask?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I haven\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t seen her for years, that is all.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  \
What an absurd reason!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  All reasons are absurd.\\n\\nMABEL \
CHILTERN.  What sort of a woman is she?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Oh! a genius in \
the daytime and a beauty at night!\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  I dislike her \
already.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  That shows your admirable good \
taste.\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  [_Approaching_.]  Ah, the English young lady \
is the\\ndragon of good taste, is she not?  Quite the dragon of good \
taste.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  So the newspapers are always telling \
us.\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  I read all your English newspapers.  I find them \
so\\namusing.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Then, my dear Nanjac, you must certainly \
read between the\\nlines.\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  I should like to, but my \
professor objects.  [_To_\\nMABEL CHILTERN.]  May I have the pleasure of \
escorting you to the\\nmusic-room, Mademoiselle?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  \
[_Looking very disappointed_.]  Delighted, Vicomte,\\nquite delighted!  \
[_Turning to_ LORD GORING.]  Aren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you coming to \
the\\nmusic-room?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Not if there is any music going on, Miss \
Mabel.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_Severely_.]  The music is in German.  You \
would not\\nunderstand it.\\n\\n[_Goes out with the_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  LORD \
CAVERSHAM _comes up to his\\nson_.]\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir! what are \
you doing here?  Wasting your life\\nas usual!  You should be in bed, sir.  \
You keep too late hours!  I heard\\nof you the other night at Lady Rufford\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s dancing till four o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock in \
the\\nmorning!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Only a quarter to four, father.\\n\\nLORD \
CAVERSHAM.  Can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t make out how you stand London Society.  \
The thing\\nhas gone to the dogs, a lot of damned nobodies talking about \
nothing.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I love talking about nothing, father.  It is the \
only thing\\nI know anything about.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  You seem to me to \
be living entirely for pleasure.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  What else is there to \
live for, father?  Nothing ages like\\nhappiness.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  You \
are heartless, sir, very heartless!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I hope not, father.  \
Good evening, Lady Basildon!\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  [_Arching two pretty \
eyebrows_.]  Are you here?  I had no\\nidea you ever came to political \
parties!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I adore political parties.  They are the only \
place left to\\nus where people don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t talk \
politics.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  I delight in talking politics.  I talk them \
all day long.\\nBut I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t bear listening to them.  I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know how the unfortunate men\\nin the House stand these \
long debates.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  By never listening.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  \
Really?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_In his most serious manner_.]  Of course.  You \
see, it is\\na very dangerous thing to listen.  If one listens one may be \
convinced;\\nand a man who allows himself to be convinced by an argument is a\
\\nthoroughly unreasonable person.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  Ah! that accounts for \
so much in men that I have never\\nunderstood, and so much in women that \
their husbands never appreciate in\\nthem!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  [_With a \
sigh_.]  Our husbands never appreciate anything\\nin us.  We have to go to \
others for that!\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  [_Emphatically_.]  Yes, always to \
others, have we not?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Smiling_.]  And those are the views \
of the two ladies who\\nare known to have the most admirable husbands in \
London.\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  That is exactly what we can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
stand.  My Reginald is\\nquite hopelessly faultless.  He is really \
unendurably so, at times!\\nThere is not the smallest element of excitement \
in knowing him.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  How terrible!  Really, the thing should be \
more widely\\nknown!\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  Basildon is quite as bad; he is as \
domestic as if he was\\na bachelor.\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Pressing_ LADY \
BASILDON\[CloseCurlyQuote]S _hand_.]  My poor Olivia!\\nWe have married \
perfect husbands, and we are well punished for it.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I \
should have thought it was the husbands who were\\npunished.\\n\\nMRS. \
MARCHMONT.  [_Drawing herself up_.]  Oh, dear no!  They are as happy\\nas \
possible!  And as for trusting us, it is tragic how much they \
trust\\nus.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  Perfectly tragic!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Or \
comic, Lady Basildon?\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  Certainly not comic, Lord Goring.  \
How unkind of you to\\nsuggest such a thing!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  I am \
afraid Lord Goring is in the camp of the enemy, as\\nusual.  I saw him \
talking to that Mrs. Cheveley when he came in.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Handsome \
woman, Mrs. Cheveley!\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  [_Stiffly_.]  Please don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t praise other women in our\\npresence.  You might wait for \
us to do that!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I did wait.\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  Well, we \
are not going to praise her.  I hear she went\\nto the Opera on Monday night, \
and told Tommy Rufford at supper that, as\\nfar as she could see, London \
Society was entirely made up of dowdies and\\ndandies.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  She \
is quite right, too.  The men are all dowdies and the\\nwomen are all \
dandies, aren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t they?\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  [_After a \
pause_.]  Oh! do you really think that is what\\nMrs. Cheveley \
meant?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Of course.  And a very sensible remark for Mrs. \
Cheveley to\\nmake, too.\\n\\n[_Enter_ MABEL CHILTERN.  _She joins the \
group_.]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Why are you talking about Mrs. Cheveley?  \
Everybody is\\ntalking about Mrs. Cheveley!  Lord Goring says\[LongDash]what \
did you say, Lord\\nGoring, about Mrs. Cheveley?  Oh! I remember, that she \
was a genius in\\nthe daytime and a beauty at night.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  \
What a horrid combination!  So very unnatural!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  [_In her \
most dreamy manner_.]  I like looking at\\ngeniuses, and listening to \
beautiful people.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Ah! that is morbid of you, Mrs. \
Marchmont!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Brightening to a look of real pleasure_.]  \
I am so\\nglad to hear you say that.  Marchmont and I have been married for \
seven\\nyears, and he has never once told me that I was morbid.  Men are \
so\\npainfully unobservant!\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  [_Turning to her_.]  I have \
always said, dear Margaret,\\nthat you were the most morbid person in London.\
\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  Ah! but you are always sympathetic, Olivia!\\n\\nMABEL \
CHILTERN.  Is it morbid to have a desire for food?  I have a great\\ndesire \
for food.  Lord Goring, will you give me some supper?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  With \
pleasure, Miss Mabel.  [_Moves away with her_.]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  How \
horrid you have been!  You have never talked to me\\nthe whole \
evening!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  How could I?  You went away with the \
child-diplomatist.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  You might have followed us.  Pursuit \
would have been\\nonly polite.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think I like you at \
all this evening!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I like you immensely.\\n\\nMABEL \
CHILTERN.  Well, I wish you\[CloseCurlyQuote]d show it in a more marked way!  \
[_They\\ngo downstairs_.]\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  Olivia, I have a curious \
feeling of absolute faintness.\\nI think I should like some supper very much. \
 I know I should like some\\nsupper.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  I am positively \
dying for supper, Margaret!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  Men are so horribly \
selfish, they never think of these\\nthings.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  Men are \
grossly material, grossly material!\\n\\n[_The_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC _enters \
from the music-room with some other\\nguests_.  _After having carefully \
examined all the people present_, _he\\napproaches_ LADY \
BASILDON.]\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  May I have the honour of taking you down \
to supper,\\nComtesse?\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  [_Coldly_.]  I never take supper, \
thank you, Vicomte.\\n[_The_ VICOMTE _is about to retire_.  LADY BASILDON, \
_seeing this_,\\n_rises at once and takes his arm_.]  But I will come down \
with you with\\npleasure.\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  I am so fond of eating!  I \
am very English in all my\\ntastes.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  You look quite \
English, Vicomte, quite English.\\n\\n[_They pass out_.  MR. MONTFORD, _a \
perfectly groomed young dandy_,\\n_approaches_ MRS. MARCHMONT.]\\n\\nMR. \
MONTFORD.  Like some supper, Mrs. Marchmont?\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  \
[_Languidly_.]  Thank you, Mr. Montford, I never touch\\nsupper.  [_Rises \
hastily and takes his arm_.]  But I will sit beside you,\\nand watch \
you.\\n\\nMR. MONTFORD.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know that I like being \
watched when I am eating!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  Then I will watch some one \
else.\\n\\nMR. MONTFORD.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know that I should like \
that either.\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Severely_.]  Pray, Mr. Montford, do not \
make these\\npainful scenes of jealousy in public!\\n\\n[_They go downstairs \
with the other guests_, _passing_ SIR ROBERT\\nCHILTERN _and_ MRS. CHEVELEY, \
_who now enter_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And are you going to any of our \
country houses\\nbefore you leave England, Mrs. Cheveley?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY. \
 Oh, no!  I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t stand your English house-parties.  \
In\\nEngland people actually try to be brilliant at breakfast.  That is \
so\\ndreadful of them!  Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.  And \
then\\nthe family skeleton is always reading family prayers.  My stay in \
England\\nreally depends on you, Sir Robert.  [_Sits down on the \
sofa_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Taking a seat beside her_.]  \
Seriously?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Quite seriously.  I want to talk to you about \
a great\\npolitical and financial scheme, about this Argentine Canal Company, \
in\\nfact.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What a tedious, practical subject for \
you to talk\\nabout, Mrs. Cheveley!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I like tedious, \
practical subjects.  What I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nlike are tedious, \
practical people.  There is a wide difference.\\nBesides, you are interested, \
I know, in International Canal schemes.  You\\nwere Lord Radley\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s secretary, weren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you, when the \
Government bought the\\nSuez Canal shares?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes.  \
But the Suez Canal was a very great and\\nsplendid undertaking.  It gave us \
our direct route to India.  It had\\nimperial value.  It was necessary that \
we should have control.  This\\nArgentine scheme is a commonplace Stock \
Exchange swindle.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  A speculation, Sir Robert!  A \
brilliant, daring\\nspeculation.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Believe me, Mrs. \
Cheveley, it is a swindle.  Let us\\ncall things by their proper names.  It \
makes matters simpler.  We have\\nall the information about it at the Foreign \
Office.  In fact, I sent out\\na special Commission to inquire into the \
matter privately, and they\\nreport that the works are hardly begun, and as \
for the money already\\nsubscribed, no one seems to know what has become of \
it.  The whole thing\\nis a second Panama, and with not a quarter of the \
chance of success that\\nmiserable affair ever had.  I hope you have not \
invested in it.  I am\\nsure you are far too clever to have done \
that.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I have invested very largely in it.\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  Who could have advised you to do such a foolish\\nthing?\\n\
\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Your old friend\[LongDash]and mine.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  Who?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Baron Arnheim.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN. \
 [_Frowning_.]  Ah! yes.  I remember hearing, at the\\ntime of his death, \
that he had been mixed up in the whole affair.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  It was \
his last romance.  His last but one, to do him\\njustice.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  [_Rising_.]  But you have not seen my Corots yet.\\nThey are in \
the music-room.  Corots seem to go with music, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
they?\\nMay I show them to you?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Shaking her head_.]  I \
am not in a mood to-night for\\nsilver twilights, or rose-pink dawns.  I want \
to talk business.\\n[_Motions to him with her fan to sit down again beside \
her_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I fear I have no advice to give you, Mrs. \
Cheveley,\\nexcept to interest yourself in something less dangerous.  The \
success of\\nthe Canal depends, of course, on the attitude of England, and I \
am going\\nto lay the report of the Commissioners before the House to-morrow \
night.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  That you must not do.  In your own interests, Sir \
Robert,\\nto say nothing of mine, you must not do that.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  [_Looking at her in wonder_.]  In my own interests?\\nMy dear Mrs. \
Cheveley, what do you mean?  [_Sits down beside her_.]\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
Sir Robert, I will be quite frank with you.  I want you\\nto withdraw the \
report that you had intended to lay before the House, on\\nthe ground that \
you have reasons to believe that the Commissioners have\\nbeen prejudiced or \
misinformed, or something.  Then I want you to say a\\nfew words to the \
effect that the Government is going to reconsider the\\nquestion, and that \
you have reason to believe that the Canal, if\\ncompleted, will be of great \
international value.  You know the sort of\\nthings ministers say in cases of \
this kind.  A few ordinary platitudes\\nwill do.  In modern life nothing \
produces such an effect as a good\\nplatitude.  It makes the whole world kin. \
 Will you do that for me?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Mrs. Cheveley, you \
cannot be serious in making me\\nsuch a proposition!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I \
am quite serious.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Coldly_.]  Pray allow me to \
believe that you are\\nnot.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Speaking with great \
deliberation and emphasis_.]  Ah!\\nbut I am.  And if you do what I ask you, \
I . . . will pay you very\\nhandsomely!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Pay me!\\n\
\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am afraid I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t quite understand what you mean.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
[_Leaning back on the sofa and looking at him_.]  How\\nvery disappointing!  \
And I have come all the way from Vienna in order\\nthat you should thoroughly \
understand me.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I fear I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t.\\n\
\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_In her most nonchalant manner_.]  My dear Sir \
Robert,\\nyou are a man of the world, and you have your price, I \
suppose.\\nEverybody has nowadays.  The drawback is that most people are \
so\\ndreadfully expensive.  I know I am.  I hope you will be more \
reasonable\\nin your terms.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Rises indignantly_.] \
 If you will allow me, I\\nwill call your carriage for you.  You have lived \
so long abroad, Mrs.\\nCheveley, that you seem to be unable to realise that \
you are talking to\\nan English gentleman.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Detains him \
by touching his arm with her fan_, _and\\nkeeping it there while she is \
talking_.]  I realise that I am talking to\\na man who laid the foundation of \
his fortune by selling to a Stock\\nExchange speculator a Cabinet \
secret.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Biting his lip_.]  What do you \
mean?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Rising and facing him_.]  I mean that I know the \
real\\norigin of your wealth and your career, and I have got your letter, \
too.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What letter?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
[_Contemptuously_.]  The letter you wrote to Baron\\nArnheim, when you were \
Lord Radley\[CloseCurlyQuote]s secretary, telling the Baron to buy\\nSuez \
Canal shares\[LongDash]a letter written three days before the \
Government\\nannounced its own purchase.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
[_Hoarsely_.]  It is not true.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  You thought that letter \
had been destroyed.  How foolish\\nof you!  It is in my possession.\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  The affair to which you allude was no more than \
a\\nspeculation.  The House of Commons had not yet passed the bill; it \
might\\nhave been rejected.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  It was a swindle, Sir \
Robert.  Let us call things by\\ntheir proper names.  It makes everything \
simpler.  And now I am going to\\nsell you that letter, and the price I ask \
for it is your public support\\nof the Argentine scheme.  You made your own \
fortune out of one canal.\\nYou must help me and my friends to make our \
fortunes out of another!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  It is infamous, what you \
propose\[LongDash]infamous!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, no!  This is the game of \
life as we all have to play\\nit, Sir Robert, sooner or later!\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  I cannot do what you ask me.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  You mean \
you cannot help doing it.  You know you are\\nstanding on the edge of a \
precipice.  And it is not for you to make\\nterms.  It is for you to accept \
them.  Supposing you refuse\[LongDash]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What \
then?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  My dear Sir Robert, what then?  You are ruined, \
that is\\nall!  Remember to what a point your Puritanism in England has \
brought\\nyou.  In old days nobody pretended to be a bit better than \
his\\nneighbours.  In fact, to be a bit better than one\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
neighbour was\\nconsidered excessively vulgar and middle-class.  Nowadays, \
with our\\nmodern mania for morality, every one has to pose as a paragon of \
purity,\\nincorruptibility, and all the other seven deadly \
virtues\[LongDash]and what is the\\nresult?  You all go over like ninepins\
\[LongDash]one after the other.  Not a year\\npasses in England without \
somebody disappearing.  Scandals used to lend\\ncharm, or at least interest, \
to a man\[LongDash]now they crush him.  And yours is a\\nvery nasty scandal. \
You couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t survive it.  If it were known that as a\\nyoung \
man, secretary to a great and important minister, you sold a\\nCabinet secret \
for a large sum of money, and that that was the origin of\\nyour wealth and \
career, you would be hounded out of public life, you\\nwould disappear \
completely.  And after all, Sir Robert, why should you\\nsacrifice your \
entire future rather than deal diplomatically with your\\nenemy?  For the \
moment I am your enemy.  I admit it!  And I am much\\nstronger than you are.  \
The big battalions are on my side.  You have a\\nsplendid position, but it is \
your splendid position that makes you so\\nvulnerable.  You can\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t defend it!  And I am in attack.  Of course I have\\nnot \
talked morality to you.  You must admit in fairness that I have\\nspared you \
that.  Years ago you did a clever, unscrupulous thing; it\\nturned out a \
great success.  You owe to it your fortune and position.\\nAnd now you have \
got to pay for it.  Sooner or later we have all to pay\\nfor what we do.  You \
have to pay now.  Before I leave you to-night, you\\nhave got to promise me \
to suppress your report, and to speak in the House\\nin favour of this \
scheme.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What you ask is impossible.\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  You must make it possible.  You are going to make it\\npossible.  \
Sir Robert, you know what your English newspapers are like.\\nSuppose that \
when I leave this house I drive down to some newspaper\\noffice, and give \
them this scandal and the proofs of it!  Think of their\\nloathsome joy, of \
the delight they would have in dragging you down, of\\nthe mud and mire they \
would plunge you in.  Think of the hypocrite with\\nhis greasy smile penning \
his leading article, and arranging the foulness\\nof the public \
placard.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Stop!  You want me to withdraw the report \
and to\\nmake a short speech stating that I believe there are possibilities \
in the\\nscheme?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Sitting down on the sofa_.]  Those \
are my terms.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_In a low voice_.]  I will give you \
any sum of\\nmoney you want.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Even you are not rich \
enough, Sir Robert, to buy back\\nyour past.  No man is.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  I will not do what you ask me.  I will not.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
You have to.  If you don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t . . . [_Rises from the sofa_.]\\n\
\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Bewildered and unnerved_.]  Wait a moment!  \
What\\ndid you propose?  You said that you would give me back my letter, didn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nyou?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  That is agreed.  I will \
be in the Ladies\[CloseCurlyQuote] Gallery\\nto-morrow night at half-past \
eleven.  If by that time\[LongDash]and you will have\\nhad heaps of \
opportunity\[LongDash]you have made an announcement to the House in\\nthe \
terms I wish, I shall hand you back your letter with the prettiest\\nthanks, \
and the best, or at any rate the most suitable, compliment I can\\nthink of.  \
I intend to play quite fairly with you.  One should always\\nplay fairly . . \
. when one has the winning cards.  The Baron taught me\\nthat . . . amongst \
other things.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You must let me have time to \
consider your\\nproposal.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  No; you must settle \
now!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Give me a week\[LongDash]three \
days!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Impossible!  I have got to telegraph to Vienna \
to-night.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  My God! what brought you into my \
life?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Circumstances.  [_Moves towards the \
door_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t go.  I consent.  \
The report shall be\\nwithdrawn.  I will arrange for a question to be put to \
me on the subject.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Thank you.  I knew we should come to \
an amicable\\nagreement.  I understood your nature from the first.  I \
analysed you,\\nthough you did not adore me.  And now you can get my carriage \
for me, Sir\\nRobert.  I see the people coming up from supper, and Englishmen \
always\\nget romantic after a meal, and that bores me dreadfully.  [_Exit_ \
SIR\\nROBERT CHILTERN.]\\n\\n[_Enter Guests_, LADY CHILTERN, LADY MARKBY, \
LORD CAVERSHAM, LADY\\nBASILDON, MRS. MARCHMONT, VICOMTE DE NANJAC, MR. \
MONTFORD.]\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Well, dear Mrs. Cheveley, I hope you have \
enjoyed yourself.\\nSir Robert is very entertaining, is he not?\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  Most entertaining!  I have enjoyed my talk with \
him\\nimmensely.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  He has had a very interesting and \
brilliant career.  And he\\nhas married a most admirable wife.  Lady Chiltern \
is a woman of the very\\nhighest principles, I am glad to say.  I am a little \
too old now, myself,\\nto trouble about setting a good example, but I always \
admire people who\\ndo.  And Lady Chiltern has a very ennobling effect on \
life, though her\\ndinner-parties are rather dull sometimes.  But one can\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have everything,\\ncan one?  And now I must go, dear.  \
Shall I call for you to-morrow?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.\\n\\nLADY \
MARKBY.  We might drive in the Park at five.  Everything looks so\\nfresh in \
the Park now!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Except the people!\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  \
Perhaps the people are a little jaded.  I have often\\nobserved that the \
Season as it goes on produces a kind of softening of\\nthe brain.  However, I \
think anything is better than high intellectual\\npressure.  That is the most \
unbecoming thing there is.  It makes the\\nnoses of the young girls so \
particularly large.  And there is nothing so\\ndifficult to marry as a large \
nose; men don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like them.  Good-night,\\ndear!  [_To_ LADY \
CHILTERN.]  Good-night, Gertrude!  [_Goes out on_ LORD\\nCAVERSHAM\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]S _arm_.]\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  What a charming house you \
have, Lady Chiltern!  I have\\nspent a delightful evening.  It has been so \
interesting getting to know\\nyour husband.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Why did you \
wish to meet my husband, Mrs. Cheveley?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I will tell \
you.  I wanted to interest him in this\\nArgentine Canal scheme, of which I \
dare say you have heard.  And I found\\nhim most \
susceptible,\[LongDash]susceptible to reason, I mean.  A rare thing in \
a\\nman.  I converted him in ten minutes.  He is going to make a speech \
in\\nthe House to-morrow night in favour of the idea.  We must go to \
the\\nLadies\[CloseCurlyQuote] Gallery and hear him!  It will be a great \
occasion!\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  There must be some mistake.  That scheme could \
never have\\nmy husband\[CloseCurlyQuote]s support.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, \
I assure you it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s all settled.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
regret my\\ntedious journey from Vienna now.  It has been a great success.  \
But, of\\ncourse, for the next twenty-four hours the whole thing is a dead \
secret.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Gently_.]  A secret?  Between whom?\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  [_With a flash of amusement in her eyes_.]  Between your\\nhusband \
and myself.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Entering_.]  Your carriage is here, \
Mrs.\\nCheveley!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks!  Good evening, Lady Chiltern!  \
Good-night, Lord\\nGoring!  I am at Claridge\[CloseCurlyQuote]s.  Don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you think you might leave a card?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  If \
you wish it, Mrs. Cheveley!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
be so solemn about it, or I shall be obliged to\\nleave a card on you.  In \
England I suppose that would hardly be\\nconsidered en r\[EGrave]gle.  \
Abroad, we are more civilised.  Will you see me\\ndown, Sir Robert?  Now that \
we have both the same interests at heart we\\nshall be great friends, I hope!\
\\n\\n[_Sails out on_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN\[CloseCurlyQuote]S _arm_.  LADY \
CHILTERN _goes to the\\ntop of the staircase and looks down at them as they \
descend_.  _Her\\nexpression is troubled_.  _After a little time she is \
joined by some of\\nthe guests_, _and passes with them into another \
reception-room_.]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  What a horrid woman!\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  You should go to bed, Miss Mabel.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Lord Goring!\
\\n\\nLORD GORING.  My father told me to go to bed an hour ago.  I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see\\nwhy I shouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t give you the same \
advice.  I always pass on good advice.\\nIt is the only thing to do with it.  \
It is never of any use to oneself.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Lord Goring, you are \
always ordering me out of the room.\\nI think it most courageous of you.  \
Especially as I am not going to bed\\nfor hours.  [_Goes over to the sofa_.]  \
You can come and sit down if you\\nlike, and talk about anything in the \
world, except the Royal Academy,\\nMrs. Cheveley, or novels in Scotch \
dialect.  They are not improving\\nsubjects.  [_Catches sight of something \
that is lying on the sofa half\\nhidden by the cushion_.]  What is this?  \
Some one has dropped a diamond\\nbrooch!  Quite beautiful, isn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t it?  [_Shows it to him_.]  I wish it was\\nmine, but \
Gertrude won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t let me wear anything but pearls, and I \
am\\nthoroughly sick of pearls.  They make one look so plain, so good and \
so\\nintellectual.  I wonder whom the brooch belongs to.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I \
wonder who dropped it.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  It is a beautiful \
brooch.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  It is a handsome bracelet.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  \
It isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t a bracelet.  It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a \
brooch.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  It can be used as a bracelet.  [_Takes it from \
her_, _and_,\\n_pulling out a green letter-case_, _puts the ornament \
carefully in it_,\\n_and replaces the whole thing in his breast-pocket with \
the most perfect\\nsang froid_.]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  What are you doing?\\n\
\\nLORD GORING.  Miss Mabel, I am going to make a rather strange request \
to\\nyou.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_Eagerly_.]  Oh, pray do!  I have been \
waiting for it\\nall the evening.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Is a little taken \
aback_, _but recovers himself_.]  Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nmention to anybody \
that I have taken charge of this brooch.  Should any\\none write and claim \
it, let me know at once.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  That is a strange \
request.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Well, you see I gave this brooch to somebody \
once, years\\nago.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  You did?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
Yes.\\n\\n[LADY CHILTERN _enters alone_.  _The other guests have \
gone_.]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Then I shall certainly bid you good-night.  \
Good-night,\\nGertrude!  [_Exit_.]\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Good-night, dear!  \
[_To_ LORD GORING.]  You saw whom Lady\\nMarkby brought here \
to-night?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Yes.  It was an unpleasant surprise.  What did \
she come\\nhere for?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Apparently to try and lure Robert \
to uphold some\\nfraudulent scheme in which she is interested.  The Argentine \
Canal, in\\nfact.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  She has mistaken her man, hasn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t she?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  She is incapable of \
understanding an upright nature like\\nmy \
husband\[CloseCurlyQuote]s!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Yes.  I should fancy she came \
to grief if she tried to get\\nRobert into her toils.  It is extraordinary \
what astounding mistakes\\nclever women make.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t call women of that kind clever.  I call them\\nstupid!\\n\
\\nLORD GORING.  Same thing often.  Good-night, Lady Chiltern!\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  Good-night!\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  My dear Arthur, you are not going?  Do stop a\\nlittle!\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Afraid I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t, thanks.  I have promised to look in \
at the\\nHartlocks\[CloseCurlyQuote].  I believe they have got a mauve \
Hungarian band that plays\\nmauve Hungarian music.  See you soon.  \
Good-bye!\\n\\n[_Exit_]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  How beautiful you look \
to-night, Gertrude!\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Robert, it is not true, is it?  You \
are not going to lend\\nyour support to this Argentine speculation?  You \
couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Starting_.]  Who told \
you I intended to do so?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  That woman who has just gone \
out, Mrs. Cheveley, as she\\ncalls herself now.  She seemed to taunt me with \
it.  Robert, I know this\\nwoman.  You don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t.  We were at \
school together.  She was untruthful,\\ndishonest, an evil influence on every \
one whose trust or friendship she\\ncould win.  I hated, I despised her.  She \
stole things, she was a thief.\\nShe was sent away for being a thief.  Why do \
you let her influence you?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude, what you tell \
me may be true, but it\\nhappened many years ago.  It is best forgotten!  \
Mrs. Cheveley may have\\nchanged since then.  No one should be entirely \
judged by their past.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Sadly_.]  One\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
past is what one is.  It is the only\\nway by which people should be \
judged.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  That is a hard saying, Gertrude!\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  It is a true saying, Robert.  And what did she mean by\\nboasting \
that she had got you to lend your support, your name, to a thing\\nI have \
heard you describe as the most dishonest and fraudulent scheme\\nthere has \
ever been in political life?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Biting his lip_.]  \
I was mistaken in the view I\\ntook.  We all may make mistakes.\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  But you told me yesterday that you had received the\\nreport from \
the Commission, and that it entirely condemned the whole\\nthing.\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Walking up and down_.]  I have reasons now to\\nbelieve \
that the Commission was prejudiced, or, at any rate, misinformed.\\nBesides, \
Gertrude, public and private life are different things.  They\\nhave \
different laws, and move on different lines.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  They should \
both represent man at his highest.  I see no\\ndifference between \
them.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Stopping_.]  In the present case, on a \
matter of\\npractical politics, I have changed my mind.  That is \
all.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  All!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Sternly_.]  \
Yes!\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Robert!  Oh! it is horrible that I should have to \
ask you\\nsuch a question\[LongDash]Robert, are you telling me the whole \
truth?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Why do you ask me such a \
question?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_After a pause_.]  Why do you not answer \
it?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Sitting down_.]  Gertrude, truth is a \
very\\ncomplex thing, and politics is a very complex business.  There are \
wheels\\nwithin wheels.  One may be under certain obligations to people that \
one\\nmust pay.  Sooner or later in political life one has to \
compromise.\\nEvery one does.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Compromise?  Robert, why \
do you talk so differently\\nto-night from the way I have always heard you \
talk?  Why are you changed?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am not changed.  But \
circumstances alter things.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Circumstances should never \
alter principles!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  But if I told \
you\[LongDash]\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  What?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  That it \
was necessary, vitally necessary?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  It can never be \
necessary to do what is not honourable.\\nOr if it be necessary, then what is \
it that I have loved!  But it is not,\\nRobert; tell me it is not.  Why \
should it be?  What gain would you get?\\nMoney?  We have no need of that!  \
And money that comes from a tainted\\nsource is a degradation.  Power?  But \
power is nothing in itself.  It is\\npower to do good that is \
fine\[LongDash]that, and that only.  What is it, then?\\nRobert, tell me why \
you are going to do this dishonourable thing!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
Gertrude, you have no right to use that word.  I\\ntold you it was a question \
of rational compromise.  It is no more than\\nthat.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  \
Robert, that is all very well for other men, for men who\\ntreat life simply \
as a sordid speculation; but not for you, Robert, not\\nfor you.  You are \
different.  All your life you have stood apart from\\nothers.  You have never \
let the world soil you.  To the world, as to\\nmyself, you have been an ideal \
always.  Oh! be that ideal still.  That\\ngreat inheritance throw not away\
\[LongDash]that tower of ivory do not destroy.\\nRobert, men can love what is \
beneath them\[LongDash]things unworthy, stained,\\ndishonoured.  We women \
worship when we love; and when we lose our\\nworship, we lose everything.  \
Oh! don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t kill my love for you, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
kill\\nthat!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude!\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I know \
that there are men with horrible secrets in their\\nlives\[LongDash]men who \
have done some shameful thing, and who in some critical\\nmoment have to pay \
for it, by doing some other act of shame\[LongDash]oh! don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\
\\ntell me you are such as they are!  Robert, is there in your life \
any\\nsecret dishonour or disgrace?  Tell me, tell me at once, \
that\[LongDash]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  That what?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  \
[_Speaking very slowly_.]  That our lives may drift\\napart.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  Drift apart?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  That they may be entirely \
separate.  It would be better\\nfor us both.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
Gertrude, there is nothing in my past life that you\\nmight not \
know.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I was sure of it, Robert, I was sure of it.  But \
why did\\nyou say those dreadful things, things so unlike your real self?  \
Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nlet us ever talk about the subject again.  You will \
write, won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you, to\\nMrs. Cheveley, and tell her that you \
cannot support this scandalous\\nscheme of hers?  If you have given her any \
promise you must take it back,\\nthat is all!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Must \
I write and tell her that?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Surely, Robert!  What else is \
there to do?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I might see her personally.  It would \
be better.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  You must never see her again, Robert.  She is \
not a woman\\nyou should ever speak to.  She is not worthy to talk to a man \
like you.\\nNo; you must write to her at once, now, this moment, and let your \
letter\\nshow her that your decision is quite irrevocable!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  Write this moment!\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Yes.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  But it is so late.  It is close on twelve.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  \
That makes no matter.  She must know at once that she has\\nbeen mistaken in \
you\[LongDash]and that you are not a man to do anything base or\\nunderhand \
or dishonourable.  Write here, Robert.  Write that you decline\\nto support \
this scheme of hers, as you hold it to be a dishonest \
scheme.\\nYes\[LongDash]write the word dishonest.  She knows what that word \
means.  [SIR\\nROBERT CHILTERN _sits down and writes a letter_.  _His wife \
takes it up\\nand reads it_.]  Yes; that will do.  [_Rings bell_.]  And now \
the\\nenvelope.  [_He writes the envelope slowly_.  _Enter_ MASON.]  Have \
this\\nletter sent at once to Claridge\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Hotel.  There is no \
answer.  [_Exit_\\nMASON.  LADY CHILTERN _kneels down beside her husband_, \
_and puts her\\narms around him_.]  Robert, love gives one an instinct to \
things.  I feel\\nto-night that I have saved you from something that might \
have been a\\ndanger to you, from something that might have made men honour \
you less\\nthan they do.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think you realise \
sufficiently, Robert, that you\\nhave brought into the political life of our \
time a nobler atmosphere, a\\nfiner attitude towards life, a freer air of \
purer aims and higher\\nideals\[LongDash]I know it, and for that I love you, \
Robert.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh, love me always, Gertrude, love me \
always!\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I will love you always, because you will always \
be worthy\\nof love.  We needs must love the highest when we see it!  \
[_Kisses him\\nand rises and goes out_.]\\n\\n[SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _walks up \
and down for a moment_; _then sits down\\nand buries his face in his hands_.  \
_The Servant enters and begins\\npulling out the lights_.  SIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN _looks up_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Put out the lights, Mason, \
put out the lights!\\n\\n[_The Servant puts out the lights_.  _The room \
becomes almost dark_.\\n_The only light there is comes from the great \
chandelier that hangs over\\nthe staircase and illumines the tapestry of the \
Triumph of Love_.]\\n\\n                                 ACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\
\\nSECOND ACT\\n\\n\\nSCENE\\n\\n\\n_Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s house_.\\n\\n[LORD GORING, _dressed in the height of \
fashion_, _is lounging in an\\narmchair_.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing \
in front of the fireplace_.\\n_He is evidently in a state of great mental \
excitement and distress_.\\n_As the scene progresses he paces nervously up \
and down the room_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  My dear Robert, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
a very awkward business, very awkward\\nindeed.  You should have told your \
wife the whole thing.  Secrets from\\nother people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s wives \
are a necessary luxury in modern life.  So, at\\nleast, I am always told at \
the club by people who are bald enough to know\\nbetter.  But no man should \
have a secret from his own wife.  She\\ninvariably finds it out.  Women have \
a wonderful instinct about things.\\nThey can discover everything except the \
obvious.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Arthur, I couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t tell \
my wife.  When could I have\\ntold her?  Not last night.  It would have made \
a life-long separation\\nbetween us, and I would have lost the love of the \
one woman in the world\\nI worship, of the only woman who has ever stirred \
love within me.  Last\\nnight it would have been quite impossible.  She would \
have turned from me\\nin horror . . . in horror and in contempt.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Taking off his \
left-hand glove_.]  What a pity!  I beg\\nyour pardon, my dear fellow, I didn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t quite mean that.  But if what you\\ntell me is true, I \
should like to have a serious talk about life with\\nLady Chiltern.\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  It would be quite useless.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  May I try?\\n\
\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes; but nothing could make her alter her \
views.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Well, at the worst it would simply be a \
psychological\\nexperiment.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  All such experiments \
are terribly dangerous.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Everything is dangerous, my dear \
fellow.  If it wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t so,\\nlife wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think\\nyou should have \
told her years ago.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  When?  When we were engaged?  \
Do you think she\\nwould have married me if she had known that the origin of \
my fortune is\\nsuch as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that \
I had done\\na thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and \
dishonourable?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Slowly_.]  Yes; most men would call it \
ugly names.  There\\nis no doubt of that.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
[_Bitterly_.]  Men who every day do something of\\nthe same kind themselves.  \
Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets\\nin their own lives.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other\\npeople\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s secrets.  It distracts public attention from their \
own.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I \
did?  No\\none.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Looking at him steadily_.]  Except \
yourself, Robert.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_After a pause_.]  Of course I \
had private\\ninformation about a certain transaction contemplated by the \
Government of\\nthe day, and I acted on it.  Private information is \
practically the\\nsource of every large modern fortune.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
[_Tapping his boot with his cane_.]  And public scandal\\ninvariably the \
result.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Pacing up and down the room_.]  Arthur, \
do you\\nthink that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up\
\\nagainst me now?  Do you think it fair that a man\[CloseCurlyQuote]s whole \
career should be\\nruined for a fault done in one\[CloseCurlyQuote]s boyhood \
almost?  I was twenty-two at the\\ntime, and I had the double misfortune of \
being well-born and poor, two\\nunforgiveable things nowadays.  Is it fair \
that the folly, the sin of\\none\[CloseCurlyQuote]s youth, if men choose to \
call it a sin, should wreck a life like\\nmine, should place me in the \
pillory, should shatter all that I have\\nworked for, all that I have built \
up.  Is it fair, Arthur?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Life is never fair, Robert.  And \
perhaps it is a good thing\\nfor most of us that it is not.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  Every man of ambition has to fight his century with\\nits own \
weapons.  What this century worships is wealth.  The God of this\\ncentury is \
wealth.  To succeed one must have wealth.  At all costs one\\nmust have \
wealth.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  You underrate yourself, Robert.  Believe me, \
without wealth\\nyou could have succeeded just as well.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  When I was old, perhaps.  When I had lost my\\npassion for power, \
or could not use it.  When I was tired, worn out,\\ndisappointed.  I wanted \
my success when I was young.  Youth is the time\\nfor success.  I couldn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t wait.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Well, you certainly have had \
your success while you are\\nstill young.  No one in our day has had such a \
brilliant success.\\nUnder-Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the age of forty\
\[LongDash]that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s good\\nenough for any one, I should think.\
\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And if it is all taken away from me now?  If I \
lose\\neverything over a horrible scandal?  If I am hounded from public life?\
\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Robert, how could you have sold yourself for \
money?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Excitedly_.]  I did not sell myself for \
money.  I\\nbought success at a great price.  That is all.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
[_Gravely_.]  Yes; you certainly paid a great price for it.\\nBut what first \
made you think of doing such a thing?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Baron \
Arnheim.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Damned scoundrel!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  No; \
he was a man of a most subtle and refined\\nintellect.  A man of culture, \
charm, and distinction.  One of the most\\nintellectual men I ever \
met.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Ah! I prefer a gentlemanly fool any day.  There is \
more to\\nbe said for stupidity than people imagine.  Personally I have a \
great\\nadmiration for stupidity.  It is a sort of fellow-feeling, I suppose.\
\\nBut how did he do it?  Tell me the whole thing.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
[_Throws himself into an armchair by the\\nwriting-table_.]  One night after \
dinner at Lord Radley\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the Baron began\\ntalking about \
success in modern life as something that one could reduce\\nto an absolutely \
definite science.  With that wonderfully fascinating\\nquiet voice of his he \
expounded to us the most terrible of all\\nphilosophies, the philosophy of \
power, preached to us the most marvellous\\nof all gospels, the gospel of \
gold.  I think he saw the effect he had\\nproduced on me, for some days \
afterwards he wrote and asked me to come\\nand see him.  He was living then \
in Park Lane, in the house Lord Woolcomb\\nhas now.  I remember so well how, \
with a strange smile on his pale,\\ncurved lips, he led me through his \
wonderful picture gallery, showed me\\nhis tapestries, his enamels, his \
jewels, his carved ivories, made me\\nwonder at the strange loveliness of the \
luxury in which he lived; and\\nthen told me that luxury was nothing but a \
background, a painted scene in\\na play, and that power, power over other \
men, power over the world, was\\nthe one thing worth having, the one supreme \
pleasure worth knowing, the\\none joy one never tired of, and that in our \
century only the rich\\npossessed it.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_With great \
deliberation_.]  A thoroughly shallow creed.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
[_Rising_.]  I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think so then.  I \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think\\nso now.  Wealth has given me enormous power.  \
It gave me at the very\\noutset of my life freedom, and freedom is \
everything.  You have never\\nbeen poor, and never known what ambition is.  \
You cannot understand what\\na wonderful chance the Baron gave me.  Such a \
chance as few men get.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Fortunately for them, if one is to \
judge by results.  But\\ntell me definitely, how did the Baron finally \
persuade you to\[LongDash]well, to do\\nwhat you did?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  When I was going away he said to me that if I ever\\ncould give \
him any private information of real value he would make me a\\nvery rich man. \
 I was dazed at the prospect he held out to me, and my\\nambition and my \
desire for power were at that time boundless.  Six weeks\\nlater certain \
private documents passed through my hands.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Keeping his \
eyes steadily fixed on the carpet_.]  State\\ndocuments?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  Yes.  [LORD GORING _sighs_, _then passes his hand\\nacross his \
forehead and looks up_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I had no idea that you, of all \
men in the world, could have\\nbeen so weak, Robert, as to yield to such a \
temptation as Baron Arnheim\\nheld out to you.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
Weak?  Oh, I am sick of hearing that phrase.  Sick\\nof using it about \
others.  Weak?  Do you really think, Arthur, that it is\\nweakness that \
yields to temptation?  I tell you that there are terrible\\ntemptations that \
it requires strength, strength and courage, to yield to.\\nTo stake all one\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s life on a single moment, to risk everything on \
one\\nthrow, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care \
not\[LongDash]there is no\\nweakness in that.  There is a horrible, a \
terrible courage.  I had that\\ncourage.  I sat down the same afternoon and \
wrote Baron Arnheim the\\nletter this woman now holds.  He made \
three-quarters of a million over\\nthe transaction.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  And \
you?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I received from the Baron \[Sterling]110,000.\
\\n\\nLORD GORING.  You were worth more, Robert.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
No; that money gave me exactly what I wanted, power\\nover others.  I went \
into the House immediately.  The Baron advised me in\\nfinance from time to \
time.  Before five years I had almost trebled my\\nfortune.  Since then \
everything that I have touched has turned out a\\nsuccess.  In all things \
connected with money I have had a luck so\\nextraordinary that sometimes it \
has made me almost afraid.  I remember\\nhaving read somewhere, in some \
strange book, that when the gods wish to\\npunish us they answer our prayers.\
\\n\\nLORD GORING.  But tell me, Robert, did you never suffer any regret \
for\\nwhat you had done?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  No.  I felt that I had \
fought the century with its\\nown weapons, and won.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
[_Sadly_.]  You thought you had won.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I thought so. \
 [_After a long pause_.]  Arthur, do\\nyou despise me for what I have told \
you?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_With deep feeling in his voice_.]  I am very sorry \
for\\nyou, Robert, very sorry indeed.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t say that I suffered any remorse.  I \
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t.\\nNot remorse in the ordinary, rather silly sense of \
the word.  But I have\\npaid conscience money many times.  I had a wild hope \
that I might disarm\\ndestiny.  The sum Baron Arnheim gave me I have \
distributed twice over in\\npublic charities since then.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
[_Looking up_.]  In public charities?  Dear me! what a lot\\nof harm you must \
have done, Robert!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t say \
that, Arthur; don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t talk like that!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Never \
mind what I say, Robert!  I am always saying what I\\nshouldn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t say.  In fact, I usually say what I really think.  A \
great\\nmistake nowadays.  It makes one so liable to be misunderstood.  \
As\\nregards this dreadful business, I will help you in whatever way I \
can.\\nOf course you know that.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Thank you, Arthur, \
thank you.  But what is to be\\ndone?  What can be done?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
[_Leaning back with his hands in his pockets_.]  Well, the\\nEnglish can\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t stand a man who is always saying he is in the right, \
but\\nthey are very fond of a man who admits that he has been in the wrong.  \
It\\nis one of the best things in them.  However, in your case, Robert, \
a\\nconfession would not do.  The money, if you will allow me to say so, \
is\\n. . . awkward.  Besides, if you did make a clean breast of the \
whole\\naffair, you would never be able to talk morality again.  And in \
England a\\nman who can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t talk morality twice a week to a \
large, popular, immoral\\naudience is quite over as a serious politician.  \
There would be nothing\\nleft for him as a profession except Botany or the \
Church.  A confession\\nwould be of no use.  It would ruin you.\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  It would ruin me.  Arthur, the only thing for me to\\ndo \
now is to fight the thing out.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Rising from his chair_.]  \
I was waiting for you to say\\nthat, Robert.  It is the only thing to do now. \
 And you must begin by\\ntelling your wife the whole story.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  That I will not do.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Robert, believe me, you are \
wrong.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t do it.  It \
would kill her love for me.\\nAnd now about this woman, this Mrs. Cheveley.  \
How can I defend myself\\nagainst her?  You knew her before, Arthur, \
apparently.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Yes.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Did you know \
her well?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Arranging his necktie_.]  So little that I got \
engaged to\\nbe married to her once, when I was staying at the Tenbys\
\[CloseCurlyQuote].  The affair\\nlasted for three days . . . \
nearly.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Why was it broken off?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
[_Airily_.]  Oh, I forget.  At least, it makes no matter.\\nBy the way, have \
you tried her with money?  She used to be confoundedly\\nfond of \
money.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I offered her any sum she wanted.  She \
refused.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Then the marvellous gospel of gold breaks down \
sometimes.\\nThe rich can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t do everything, after \
all.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Not everything.  I suppose you are right.  \
Arthur,\\nI feel that public disgrace is in store for me.  I feel certain of \
it.  I\\nnever knew what terror was before.  I know it now.  It is as if a \
hand of\\nice were laid upon one\[CloseCurlyQuote]s heart.  It is as if one\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s heart were beating\\nitself to death in some empty \
hollow.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Striking the table_.]  Robert, you must fight \
her.  You\\nmust fight her.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  But how?\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t tell you how at present.  I have not the \
smallest\\nidea.  But every one has some weak point.  There is some flaw in \
each one\\nof us.  [_Strolls to the fireplace and looks at himself in the \
glass_.]\\nMy father tells me that even I have faults.  Perhaps I have.  I \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nknow.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  In defending myself \
against Mrs. Cheveley, I have a\\nright to use any weapon I can find, have I \
not?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Still looking in the glass_.]  In your place I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nthink I should have the smallest scruple in doing so.  \
She is thoroughly\\nwell able to take care of herself.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  [_Sits down at the table and takes a pen in his\\nhand_.]  Well, I \
shall send a cipher telegram to the Embassy at Vienna,\\nto inquire if there \
is anything known against her.  There may be some\\nsecret scandal she might \
be afraid of.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Settling his buttonhole_.]  Oh, I should \
fancy Mrs.\\nCheveley is one of those very modern women of our time who find \
a new\\nscandal as becoming as a new bonnet, and air them both in the Park \
every\\nafternoon at five-thirty.  I am sure she adores scandals, and that \
the\\nsorrow of her life at present is that she can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t manage \
to have enough of\\nthem.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Writing_.]  Why do you \
say that?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Turning round_.]  Well, she wore far too much \
rouge last\\nnight, and not quite enough clothes.  That is always a sign of \
despair in\\na woman.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Striking a bell_.]  But it \
is worth while my\\nwiring to Vienna, is it not?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  It is \
always worth while asking a question, though it is\\nnot always worth while \
answering one.\\n\\n[_Enter_ MASON.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Is Mr. \
Trafford in his room?\\n\\nMASON.  Yes, Sir Robert.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN. \
 [_Puts what he has written into an envelope_,\\n_which he then carefully \
closes_.]  Tell him to have this sent off in\\ncipher at once.  There must \
not be a moment\[CloseCurlyQuote]s delay.\\n\\nMASON.  Yes, Sir \
Robert.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh! just give that back to me \
again.\\n\\n[_Writes something on the envelope_.  MASON _then goes out with \
the\\nletter_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  She must have had some curious \
hold over Baron\\nArnheim.  I wonder what it was.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
[_Smiling_.]  I wonder.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I will fight her to the \
death, as long as my wife\\nknows nothing.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Strongly_.]  \
Oh, fight in any case\[LongDash]in any case.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
[_With a gesture of despair_.]  If my wife found\\nout, there would be little \
left to fight for.  Well, as soon as I hear\\nfrom Vienna, I shall let you \
know the result.  It is a chance, just a\\nchance, but I believe in it.  And \
as I fought the age with its own\\nweapons, I will fight her with her \
weapons.  It is only fair, and she\\nlooks like a woman with a past, doesn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t she?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Most pretty women do.  But there \
is a fashion in pasts just\\nas there is a fashion in frocks.  Perhaps Mrs. \
Cheveley\[CloseCurlyQuote]s past is merely\\na slightly d\[EAcute]collet\
\[EAcute] one, and they are excessively popular nowadays.\\nBesides, my dear \
Robert, I should not build too high hopes on frightening\\nMrs. Cheveley.  I \
should not fancy Mrs. Cheveley is a woman who would be\\neasily frightened.  \
She has survived all her creditors, and she shows\\nwonderful presence of \
mind.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh! I live on hopes now.  I clutch at every \
chance.\\nI feel like a man on a ship that is sinking.  The water is round my \
feet,\\nand the very air is bitter with storm.  Hush! I hear my wife\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s voice.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LADY CHILTERN _in walking \
dress_.]\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Good afternoon, Lord Goring!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
Good afternoon, Lady Chiltern!  Have you been in the Park?\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  No; I have just come from the Woman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Liberal\\nAssociation, where, by the way, Robert, your name was received with \
loud\\napplause, and now I have come in to have my tea.  [_To_ LORD \
GORING.]\\nYou will wait and have some tea, won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
you?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll wait for a short time, \
thanks.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I will be back in a moment.  I am only going to \
take my\\nhat off.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_In his most earnest manner_.]  Oh! \
please don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t.  It is\\nso pretty.  One of the prettiest hats \
I ever saw.  I hope the Woman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nLiberal Association \
received it with loud applause.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_With a smile_.]  We \
have much more important work to do\\nthan look at each other\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s bonnets, Lord Goring.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Really?  What \
sort of work?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Oh! dull, useful, delightful things, \
Factory Acts, Female\\nInspectors, the Eight Hours\[CloseCurlyQuote] Bill, \
the Parliamentary Franchise. . . .\\nEverything, in fact, that you would find \
thoroughly uninteresting.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  And never bonnets?\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  [_With mock indignation_.]  Never bonnets, never!\\n\\n[LADY \
CHILTERN _goes out through the door leading to her boudoir_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  [_Takes_ LORD GORING\[CloseCurlyQuote]S _hand_.]  You have been \
a\\ngood friend to me, Arthur, a thoroughly good friend.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know that I have been able to do much for \
you,\\nRobert, as yet.  In fact, I have not been able to do anything for you, \
as\\nfar as I can see.  I am thoroughly disappointed with myself.\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  You have enabled me to tell you the truth.  That \
is\\nsomething.  The truth has always stifled me.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Ah! the \
truth is a thing I get rid of as soon as possible!\\nBad habit, by the way.  \
Makes one very unpopular at the club . . . with\\nthe older members.  They \
call it being conceited.  Perhaps it is.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I would \
to God that I had been able to tell the\\ntruth . . . to live the truth.  Ah! \
that is the great thing in life, to\\nlive the truth.  [_Sighs_, _and goes \
towards the door_.]  I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll see you\\nsoon again, Arthur, shan\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t I?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Certainly.  Whenever you like.  I\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]m going to look in at the\\nBachelors\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Ball to-night, unless I find something better to do.  But \
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll\\ncome round to-morrow morning.  If you should want me \
to-night by any\\nchance, send round a note to Curzon Street.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  Thank you.\\n\\n[_As he reaches the door_, LADY CHILTERN _enters \
from her boudoir_.]\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  You are not going, Robert?\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  I have some letters to write, dear.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  \
[_Going to him_.]  You work too hard, Robert.  You seem\\nnever to think of \
yourself, and you are looking so tired.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  It is \
nothing, dear, nothing.\\n\\n[_He kisses her and goes out_.]\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  [_To_ LORD GORING.]  Do sit down.  I am so glad you have\\ncalled. \
 I want to talk to you about . . . well, not about bonnets, or\\nthe Woman\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Liberal Association.  You take far too much interest in \
the\\nfirst subject, and not nearly enough in the second.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
You want to talk to me about Mrs. Cheveley?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Yes.  You \
have guessed it.  After you left last night I\\nfound out that what she had \
said was really true.  Of course I made\\nRobert write her a letter at once, \
withdrawing his promise.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  So he gave me to \
understand.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  To have kept it would have been the first \
stain on a\\ncareer that has been stainless always.  Robert must be above \
reproach.\\nHe is not like other men.  He cannot afford to do what other men \
do.\\n[_She looks at_ LORD GORING, _who remains silent_.]  Don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you agree with\\nme?  You are Robert\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
greatest friend.  You are our greatest friend, Lord\\nGoring.  No one, except \
myself, knows Robert better than you do.  He has\\nno secrets from me, and I \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think he has any from you.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  He \
certainly has no secrets from me.  At least I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nthink \
so.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Then am I not right in my estimate of him?  I know I \
am\\nright.  But speak to me frankly.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Looking straight \
at her_.]  Quite frankly?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Surely.  You have nothing to \
conceal, have you?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Nothing.  But, my dear Lady Chiltern, I \
think, if you will\\nallow me to say so, that in practical life\[LongDash]\\n\
\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Smiling_.]  Of which you know so little, Lord Goring\
\[LongDash]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Of which I know nothing by experience, though \
I know\\nsomething by observation.  I think that in practical life there \
is\\nsomething about success, actual success, that is a little \
unscrupulous,\\nsomething about ambition that is unscrupulous always.  Once a \
man has set\\nhis heart and soul on getting to a certain point, if he has to \
climb the\\ncrag, he climbs the crag; if he has to walk in the \
mire\[LongDash]\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Well?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  He walks in the \
mire.  Of course I am only talking\\ngenerally about life.\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  [_Gravely_.]  I hope so.  Why do you look at me so\\nstrangely, \
Lord Goring?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern, I have sometimes thought that \
. . . perhaps\\nyou are a little hard in some of your views on life.  I think \
that . . .\\noften you don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t make sufficient allowances.  In \
every nature there are\\nelements of weakness, or worse than weakness.  \
Supposing, for instance,\\nthat\[LongDash]that any public man, my father, or \
Lord Merton, or Robert, say, had,\\nyears ago, written some foolish letter to \
some one . . .\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  What do you mean by a foolish \
letter?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  A letter gravely compromising \
one\[CloseCurlyQuote]s position.  I am only\\nputting an imaginary \
case.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Robert is as incapable of doing a foolish thing as \
he is\\nof doing a wrong thing.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_After a long pause_.]  \
Nobody is incapable of doing a\\nfoolish thing.  Nobody is incapable of doing \
a wrong thing.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Are you a Pessimist?  What will the other \
dandies say?\\nThey will all have to go into mourning.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
[_Rising_.]  No, Lady Chiltern, I am not a Pessimist.\\nIndeed I am not sure \
that I quite know what Pessimism really means.  All\\nI do know is that life \
cannot be understood without much charity, cannot\\nbe lived without much \
charity.  It is love, and not German philosophy,\\nthat is the true \
explanation of this world, whatever may be the\\nexplanation of the next.  \
And if you are ever in trouble, Lady Chiltern,\\ntrust me absolutely, and I \
will help you in every way I can.  If you ever\\nwant me, come to me for my \
assistance, and you shall have it.  Come at\\nonce to me.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN. \
 [_Looking at him in surprise_.]  Lord Goring, you are\\ntalking quite \
seriously.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think I ever heard you talk \
seriously\\nbefore.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Laughing_.]  You must excuse me, \
Lady Chiltern.  It won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\noccur again, if I can help it.\\n\
\\nLADY CHILTERN.  But I like you to be serious.\\n\\n[_Enter_ MABEL \
CHILTERN, _in the most ravishing frock_.]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Dear \
Gertrude, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t say such a dreadful thing to Lord\\nGoring.  \
Seriousness would be very unbecoming to him.  Good afternoon\\nLord Goring!  \
Pray be as trivial as you can.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I should like to, Miss \
Mabel, but I am afraid I am . . . a\\nlittle out of practice this morning; \
and besides, I have to be going now.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Just when I have \
come in!  What dreadful manners you\\nhave!  I am sure you were very badly \
brought up.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I was.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  I wish I had \
brought you up!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I am so sorry you didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t.\
\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  It is too late now, I suppose?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
[_Smiling_.]  I am not so sure.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Will you ride to-morrow \
morning?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Yes, at ten.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t forget.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Of course I shan\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t.  By the way, Lady Chiltern, there is no\\nlist of your \
guests in _The Morning Post_ of to-day.  It has apparently\\nbeen crowded out \
by the County Council, or the Lambeth Conference, or\\nsomething equally \
boring.  Could you let me have a list?  I have a\\nparticular reason for \
asking you.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I am sure Mr. Trafford will be able to give \
you one.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Thanks, so much.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Tommy is \
the most useful person in London.\\n\\nLORD GORING [_Turning to her_.]  And \
who is the most ornamental?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN [_Triumphantly_.]  I \
am.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  How clever of you to guess it!  [_Takes up his hat and\
\\ncane_.]  Good-bye, Lady Chiltern!  You will remember what I said to \
you,\\nwon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Yes; but I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know why you said it to me.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I hardly \
know myself.  Good-bye, Miss Mabel!\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN [_With a little moue \
of disappointment_.]  I wish you were\\nnot going.  I have had four wonderful \
adventures this morning; four and a\\nhalf, in fact.  You might stop and \
listen to some of them.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  How very selfish of you to have \
four and a half!  There\\nwon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be any left for \
me.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want you to have any.  \
They would not be good\\nfor you.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  That is the first unkind \
thing you have ever said to me.\\nHow charmingly you said it!  Ten to-morrow.\
\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Sharp.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Quite sharp.  But don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t bring Mr. Trafford.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_With a little \
toss of the head_.]  Of course I shan\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nbring Tommy \
Trafford.  Tommy Trafford is in great disgrace.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I am \
delighted to hear it.  [_Bows and goes out_.]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Gertrude, \
I wish you would speak to Tommy Trafford.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  What has poor \
Mr. Trafford done this time?  Robert says\\nhe is the best secretary he has \
ever had.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Well, Tommy has proposed to me again.  Tommy \
really does\\nnothing but propose to me.  He proposed to me last night in the\
\\nmusic-room, when I was quite unprotected, as there was an elaborate \
trio\\ngoing on.  I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t dare to make the smallest \
repartee, I need hardly\\ntell you.  If I had, it would have stopped the \
music at once.  Musical\\npeople are so absurdly unreasonable.  They always \
want one to be\\nperfectly dumb at the very moment when one is longing to be \
absolutely\\ndeaf.  Then he proposed to me in broad daylight this morning, in \
front of\\nthat dreadful statue of Achilles.  Really, the things that go on \
in front\\nof that work of art are quite appalling.  The police should \
interfere.\\nAt luncheon I saw by the glare in his eye that he was going to \
propose\\nagain, and I just managed to check him in time by assuring him that \
I was\\na bimetallist.  Fortunately I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know what \
bimetallism means.  And I\\ndon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe anybody else does \
either.  But the observation crushed\\nTommy for ten minutes.  He looked \
quite shocked.  And then Tommy is so\\nannoying in the way he proposes.  If \
he proposed at the top of his voice,\\nI should not mind so much.  That might \
produce some effect on the public.\\nBut he does it in a horrid confidential \
way.  When Tommy wants to be\\nromantic he talks to one just like a doctor.  \
I am very fond of Tommy,\\nbut his methods of proposing are quite out of \
date.  I wish, Gertrude,\\nyou would speak to him, and tell him that once a \
week is quite often\\nenough to propose to any one, and that it should always \
be done in a\\nmanner that attracts some attention.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Dear \
Mabel, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t talk like that.  Besides, Robert thinks\\nvery \
highly of Mr. Trafford.  He believes he has a brilliant future\\nbefore \
him.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Oh! I wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t marry a man with a \
future before him for\\nanything under the sun.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  \
Mabel!\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  I know, dear.  You married a man with a future, \
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nyou?  But then Robert was a genius, and you have a \
noble,\\nself-sacrificing character.  You can stand geniuses.  I have no \
character\\nat all, and Robert is the only genius I could ever bear.  As a \
rule, I\\nthink they are quite impossible.  Geniuses talk so much, don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t they?\\nSuch a bad habit!  And they are always thinking \
about themselves, when I\\nwant them to be thinking about me.  I must go \
round now and rehearse at\\nLady Basildon\[CloseCurlyQuote]s.  You remember, \
we are having tableaux, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you?  The\\nTriumph of \
something, I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know what!  I hope it will be triumph \
of\\nme.  Only triumph I am really interested in at present.  [_Kisses_ \
LADY\\nCHILTERN _and goes out_; _then comes running back_.]  Oh, Gertrude, do\
\\nyou know who is coming to see you?  That dreadful Mrs. Cheveley, in \
a\\nmost lovely gown.  Did you ask her?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Rising_.]  \
Mrs. Cheveley!  Coming to see me?\\nImpossible!\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  I \
assure you she is coming upstairs, as large as life\\nand not nearly so \
natural.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  You need not wait, Mabel.  Remember, Lady \
Basildon is\\nexpecting you.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Oh! I must shake hands \
with Lady Markby.  She is\\ndelightful.  I love being scolded by \
her.\\n\\n[_Enter_ MASON.]\\n\\nMASON.  Lady Markby.  Mrs. \
Cheveley.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LADY MARKBY _and_ MRS. CHEVELEY.]\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN. \
 [_Advancing to meet them_.]  Dear Lady Markby, how nice\\nof you to come and \
see me!  [_Shakes hands with her_, _and bows somewhat\\ndistantly to_ MRS. \
CHEVELEY.]  Won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you sit down, Mrs. Cheveley?\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  Thanks.  Isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t that Miss Chiltern?  I should like \
so much\\nto know her.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Mabel, Mrs. Cheveley wishes to \
know you.\\n\\n[MABEL CHILTERN _gives a little nod_.]\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY \
[_Sitting down_.]  I thought your frock so charming last\\nnight, Miss \
Chiltern.  So simple and . . . suitable.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Really?  I \
must tell my dressmaker.  It will be such a\\nsurprise to her.  Good-bye, \
Lady Markby!\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Going already?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  I am so \
sorry but I am obliged to.  I am just off to\\nrehearsal.  I have got to \
stand on my head in some tableaux.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  On your head, child?  \
Oh! I hope not.  I believe it is most\\nunhealthy.  [_Takes a seat on the \
sofa next_ LADY CHILTERN.]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  But it is for an excellent \
charity: in aid of the\\nUndeserving, the only people I am really interested \
in.  I am the\\nsecretary, and Tommy Trafford is treasurer.\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  And what is Lord Goring?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Oh! Lord Goring is \
president.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  The post should suit him admirably, unless he \
has\\ndeteriorated since I knew him first.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  [_Reflecting_.] \
 You are remarkably modern, Mabel.  A\\nlittle too modern, perhaps.  Nothing \
is so dangerous as being too modern.\\nOne is apt to grow old-fashioned quite \
suddenly.  I have known many\\ninstances of it.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  What a \
dreadful prospect!\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Ah! my dear, you need not be nervous.  \
You will always be\\nas pretty as possible.  That is the best fashion there \
is, and the only\\nfashion that England succeeds in setting.\\n\\nMABEL \
CHILTERN.  [_With a curtsey_.]  Thank you so much, Lady Markby, for\\nEngland \
. . . and myself.  [_Goes out_.]\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  [_Turning to_ LADY \
CHILTERN.]  Dear Gertrude, we just\\ncalled to know if Mrs. Cheveley\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s diamond brooch has been found.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Here?\
\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  I missed it when I got back to Claridge\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s, and I\\nthought I might possibly have dropped it \
here.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I have heard nothing about it.  But I will send \
for the\\nbutler and ask.  [_Touches the bell_.]\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, \
pray don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t trouble, Lady Chiltern.  I dare say I lost\\nit \
at the Opera, before we came on here.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Ah yes, I suppose it \
must have been at the Opera.  The fact\\nis, we all scramble and jostle so \
much nowadays that I wonder we have\\nanything at all left on us at the end \
of an evening.  I know myself that,\\nwhen I am coming back from the Drawing \
Room, I always feel as if I hadn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\na shred on me, except a \
small shred of decent reputation, just enough to\\nprevent the lower classes \
making painful observations through the windows\\nof the carriage.  The fact \
is that our Society is terribly\\nover-populated.  Really, some one should \
arrange a proper scheme of\\nassisted emigration.  It would do a great deal \
of good.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I quite agree with you, Lady Markby.  It is \
nearly six\\nyears since I have been in London for the Season, and I must say \
Society\\nhas become dreadfully mixed.  One sees the oddest people \
everywhere.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  That is quite true, dear.  But one needn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know them.  I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m\\nsure I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know half the people who come to my house.  Indeed, from \
all\\nI hear, I shouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like to.\\n\\n[_Enter_ \
MASON.]\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  What sort of a brooch was it that you lost, Mrs.\
\\nCheveley?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  A diamond snake-brooch with a ruby, a \
rather large ruby.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  I thought you said there was a sapphire \
on the head, dear?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY [_Smiling_.]  No, lady \
Markby\[LongDash]a ruby.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  [_Nodding her head_.]  And very \
becoming, I am quite sure.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Has a ruby and diamond brooch \
been found in any of the\\nrooms this morning, Mason?\\n\\nMASON.  No, my \
lady.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  It really is of no consequence, Lady Chiltern.  I \
am so\\nsorry to have put you to any inconvenience.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  \
[_Coldly_.]  Oh, it has been no inconvenience.  That will\\ndo, Mason.  You \
can bring tea.\\n\\n[_Exit_ MASON.]\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Well, I must say it is \
most annoying to lose anything.  I\\nremember once at Bath, years ago, losing \
in the Pump Room an exceedingly\\nhandsome cameo bracelet that Sir John had \
given me.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think he has\\never given me anything \
since, I am sorry to say.  He has sadly\\ndegenerated.  Really, this horrid \
House of Commons quite ruins our\\nhusbands for us.  I think the Lower House \
by far the greatest blow to a\\nhappy married life that there has been since \
that terrible thing called\\nthe Higher Education of Women was \
invented.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Ah! it is heresy to say that in this house, \
Lady Markby.\\nRobert is a great champion of the Higher Education of Women, \
and so, I am\\nafraid, am I.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  The higher education of men \
is what I should like to see.\\nMen need it so sadly.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  They \
do, dear.  But I am afraid such a scheme would be\\nquite unpractical.  I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think man has much capacity for development.\\nHe has got \
as far as he can, and that is not far, is it?  With regard to\\nwomen, well, \
dear Gertrude, you belong to the younger generation, and I\\nam sure it is \
all right if you approve of it.  In my time, of course, we\\nwere taught not \
to understand anything.  That was the old system, and\\nwonderfully \
interesting it was.  I assure you that the amount of things I\\nand my poor \
dear sister were taught not to understand was quite\\nextraordinary.  But \
modern women understand everything, I am told.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Except \
their husbands.  That is the one thing the modern\\nwoman never \
understands.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  And a very good thing too, dear, I dare say.  \
It might\\nbreak up many a happy home if they did.  Not yours, I need hardly \
say,\\nGertrude.  You have married a pattern husband.  I wish I could say \
as\\nmuch for myself.  But since Sir John has taken to attending the \
debates\\nregularly, which he never used to do in the good old days, his \
language\\nhas become quite impossible.  He always seems to think that he \
is\\naddressing the House, and consequently whenever he discusses the state \
of\\nthe agricultural labourer, or the Welsh Church, or something \
quite\\nimproper of that kind, I am obliged to send all the servants out of \
the\\nroom.  It is not pleasant to see one\[CloseCurlyQuote]s own butler, who \
has been with one\\nfor twenty-three years, actually blushing at the \
side-board, and the\\nfootmen making contortions in corners like persons in \
circuses.  I assure\\nyou my life will be quite ruined unless they send John \
at once to the\\nUpper House.  He won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t take any interest in \
politics then, will he?  The\\nHouse of Lords is so sensible.  An assembly of \
gentlemen.  But in his\\npresent state, Sir John is really a great trial.  \
Why, this morning\\nbefore breakfast was half over, he stood up on the \
hearthrug, put his\\nhands in his pockets, and appealed to the country at the \
top of his\\nvoice.  I left the table as soon as I had my second cup of tea, \
I need\\nhardly say.  But his violent language could be heard all over the \
house!\\nI trust, Gertrude, that Sir Robert is not like that?\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  But I am very much interested in politics, Lady Markby.\\nI love \
to hear Robert talk about them.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Well, I hope he is not as \
devoted to Blue Books as Sir John\\nis.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think they \
can be quite improving reading for any one.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY [_Languidly_.] \
 I have never read a Blue Book.  I prefer\\nbooks . . . in yellow \
covers.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  [_Genially unconscious_.]  Yellow is a gayer \
colour, is it\\nnot?  I used to wear yellow a good deal in my early days, and \
would do so\\nnow if Sir John was not so painfully personal in his \
observations, and a\\nman on the question of dress is always ridiculous, is \
he not?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, no!  I think men are the only authorities on \
dress.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Really?  One wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t say so from \
the sort of hats they\\nwear? would one?\\n\\n[_The butler enters_, _followed \
by the footman_.  _Tea is set on a small\\ntable close to_ LADY CHILTERN.]\\n\
\\nLADY CHILTERN.  May I give you some tea, Mrs. Cheveley?\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  Thanks.  [_The butler hands_ MRS. CHEVELEY _a cup of tea\\non a \
salver_.]\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Some tea, Lady Markby?\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  No \
thanks, dear.  [_The servants go out_.]  The fact is, I\\nhave promised to go \
round for ten minutes to see poor Lady Brancaster,\\nwho is in very great \
trouble.  Her daughter, quite a well-brought-up\\ngirl, too, has actually \
become engaged to be married to a curate in\\nShropshire.  It is very sad, \
very sad indeed.  I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t understand this\\nmodern mania for \
curates.  In my time we girls saw them, of course,\\nrunning about the place \
like rabbits.  But we never took any notice of\\nthem, I need hardly say.  \
But I am told that nowadays country society is\\nquite honeycombed with them. \
 I think it most irreligious.  And then the\\neldest son has quarrelled with \
his father, and it is said that when they\\nmeet at the club Lord Brancaster \
always hides himself behind the money\\narticle in _The Times_.  However, I \
believe that is quite a common\\noccurrence nowadays and that they have to \
take in extra copies of _The\\nTimes_ at all the clubs in St. James\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Street; there are so many sons \
who\\nwon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have anything to do with their fathers, and so \
many fathers who\\nwon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t speak to their sons.  I think \
myself, it is very much to be\\nregretted.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  So do I.  \
Fathers have so much to learn from their sons\\nnowadays.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  \
Really, dear?  What?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  The art of living.  The only really \
Fine Art we have\\nproduced in modern times.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  [_Shaking her \
head_.]  Ah!  I am afraid Lord Brancaster\\nknew a good deal about that.  \
More than his poor wife ever did.\\n[_Turning to_ LADY CHILTERN.]  You know \
Lady Brancaster, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you, dear?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Just \
slightly.  She was staying at Langton last autumn,\\nwhen we were \
there.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Well, like all stout women, she looks the very \
picture of\\nhappiness, as no doubt you noticed.  But there are many \
tragedies in her\\nfamily, besides this affair of the curate.  Her own \
sister, Mrs. Jekyll,\\nhad a most unhappy life; through no fault of her own, \
I am sorry to say.\\nShe ultimately was so broken-hearted that she went into \
a convent, or on\\nto the operatic stage, I forget which.  No; I think it was \
decorative\\nart-needlework she took up.  I know she had lost all sense of \
pleasure in\\nlife.  [_Rising_.]  And now, Gertrude, if you will allow me, I \
shall\\nleave Mrs. Cheveley in your charge and call back for her in a quarter \
of\\nan hour.  Or perhaps, dear Mrs. Cheveley, you wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
mind waiting in\\nthe carriage while I am with Lady Brancaster.  As I intend \
it to be a\\nvisit of condolence, I shan\[CloseCurlyQuote]t stay \
long.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY [_Rising_.]  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mind waiting \
in the carriage at all,\\nprovided there is somebody to look at \
one.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Well, I hear the curate is always prowling about the \
house.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I am afraid I am not fond of girl \
friends.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN [_Rising_.]  Oh, I hope Mrs. Cheveley will stay \
here a\\nlittle.  I should like to have a few minutes\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
conversation with her.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  How very kind of you, Lady \
Chiltern!  Believe me, nothing\\nwould give me greater pleasure.\\n\\nLADY \
MARKBY.  Ah! no doubt you both have many pleasant reminiscences of\\nyour \
schooldays to talk over together.  Good-bye, dear Gertrude!  Shall I\\nsee \
you at Lady Bonar\[CloseCurlyQuote]s to-night?  She has discovered a \
wonderful new\\ngenius.  He does . . . nothing at all, I believe.  That is a \
great\\ncomfort, is it not?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Robert and I are dining at \
home by ourselves to-night,\\nand I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think I shall go \
anywhere afterwards.  Robert, of course,\\nwill have to be in the House.  But \
there is nothing interesting on.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Dining at home by \
yourselves?  Is that quite prudent?  Ah,\\nI forgot, your husband is an \
exception.  Mine is the general rule, and\\nnothing ages a woman so rapidly \
as having married the general rule.\\n[_Exit_ LADY MARKBY.]\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  Wonderful woman, Lady Markby, isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t she?  Talks \
more and\\nsays less than anybody I ever met.  She is made to be a public \
speaker.\\nMuch more so than her husband, though he is a typical Englishman, \
always\\ndull and usually violent.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Makes no answer_, \
_but remains standing_.  _There is a\\npause_.  _Then the eyes of the two \
women meet_.  LADY CHILTERN _looks\\nstern and pale_.  MRS. CHEVELEY _seem \
rather amused_.]  Mrs. Cheveley, I\\nthink it is right to tell you quite \
frankly that, had I known who you\\nreally were, I should not have invited \
you to my house last night.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY [_With an impertinent smile_.] \
 Really?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I could not have done so.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
I see that after all these years you have not changed a\\nbit, \
Gertrude.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I never change.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY [_Elevating \
her eyebrows_.]  Then life has taught you\\nnothing?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  It \
has taught me that a person who has once been guilty\\nof a dishonest and \
dishonourable action may be guilty of it a second\\ntime, and should be \
shunned.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Would you apply that rule to every \
one?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Yes, to every one, without exception.\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  Then I am sorry for you, Gertrude, very sorry for you.\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  You see now, I was sure, that for many reasons any\\nfurther \
acquaintance between us during your stay in London is \
quite\\nimpossible?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY [_Leaning back in her chair_.]  Do you \
know, Gertrude, I\\ndon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mind your talking morality a bit.  \
Morality is simply the attitude\\nwe adopt towards people whom we personally \
dislike.  You dislike me.  I\\nam quite aware of that.  And I have always \
detested you.  And yet I have\\ncome here to do you a service.\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  [_Contemptuously_.]  Like the service you wished to\\nrender my \
husband last night, I suppose.  Thank heaven, I saved him \
from\\nthat.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Starting to her feet_.]  It was you who \
made him write\\nthat insolent letter to me?  It was you who made him break \
his promise?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Yes.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Then you must \
make him keep it.  I give you till\\nto-morrow morning\[LongDash]no more.  If \
by that time your husband does not\\nsolemnly bind himself to help me in this \
great scheme in which I am\\ninterested\[LongDash]\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  This \
fraudulent speculation\[LongDash]\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Call it what you \
choose.  I hold your husband in the\\nhollow of my hand, and if you are wise \
you will make him do what I tell\\nhim.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Rising and \
going towards her_.]  You are impertinent.\\nWhat has my husband to do with \
you?  With a woman like you?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY [_With a bitter laugh_.]  In \
this world like meets with\\nlike.  It is because your husband is himself \
fraudulent and dishonest\\nthat we pair so well together.  Between you and \
him there are chasms.  He\\nand I are closer than friends.  We are enemies \
linked together.  The same\\nsin binds us.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  How dare you \
class my husband with yourself?  How dare\\nyou threaten him or me?  Leave my \
house.  You are unfit to enter it.\\n\\n[SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _enters from \
behind_.  _He hears his wife\[CloseCurlyQuote]s last\\nwords_, _and sees to \
whom they are addressed_.  _He grows deadly pale_.]\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Your \
house!  A house bought with the price of dishonour.\\nA house, everything in \
which has been paid for by fraud.  [_Turns round\\nand sees_ SIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.]  Ask him what the origin of his fortune\\nis!  Get him to tell you \
how he sold to a stockbroker a Cabinet secret.\\nLearn from him to what you \
owe your position.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  It is not true!  Robert!  It is not \
true!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Pointing at him with outstretched finger_.]  \
Look at\\nhim!  Can he deny it?  Does he dare to?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
Go!  Go at once.  You have done your worst now.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  My \
worst?  I have not yet finished with you, with either\\nof you.  I give you \
both till to-morrow at noon.  If by then you don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t do\\nwhat \
I bid you to do, the whole world shall know the origin of \
Robert\\nChiltern.\\n\\n[SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _strikes the bell_.  _Enter_ \
MASON.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Show Mrs. Cheveley out.\\n\\n[MRS. \
CHEVELEY _starts_; _then bows with somewhat exaggerated politeness\\nto_ LADY \
CHILTERN, _who makes no sign of response_.  _As she passes by_\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN, _who is standing close to the door_, _she pauses for\\na moment and \
looks him straight in the face_.  _She then goes out_,\\n_followed by the \
servant_, _who closes the door after him_.  _The husband\\nand wife are left \
alone_.  LADY CHILTERN _stands like some one in a\\ndreadful dream_.  _Then \
she turns round and looks at her husband_.  _She\\nlooks at him with strange \
eyes_, _as though she were seeing him for the\\nfirst time_.]\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  You sold a Cabinet secret for money!  You began your life\\nwith \
fraud!  You built up your career on dishonour!  Oh, tell me it is\\nnot true! \
 Lie to me!  Lie to me!  Tell me it is not true!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
What this woman said is quite true.  But, Gertrude,\\nlisten to me.  You don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t realise how I was tempted.  Let me tell you the\\nwhole \
thing. [_Goes towards her_.]\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t come \
near me.  Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t touch me.  I feel as if you\\nhad soiled me \
for ever.  Oh! what a mask you have been wearing all these\\nyears!  A \
horrible painted mask!  You sold yourself for money.  Oh! a\\ncommon thief \
were better.  You put yourself up to sale to the highest\\nbidder!  You were \
bought in the market.  You lied to the whole world.\\nAnd yet you will not \
lie to me.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Rushing towards her_.]  Gertrude!  \
Gertrude!\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Thrusting him back with outstretched \
hands_.]  No,\\ndon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t speak!  Say nothing!  Your voice wakes \
terrible memories\[LongDash]memories\\nof things that made me love you\
\[LongDash]memories of words that made me love\\nyou\[LongDash]memories that \
now are horrible to me.  And how I worshipped you!  You\\nwere to me \
something apart from common life, a thing pure, noble, honest,\\nwithout \
stain.  The world seemed to me finer because you were in it, and\\ngoodness \
more real because you lived.  And now\[LongDash]oh, when I think that \
I\\nmade of a man like you my ideal! the ideal of my life!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  There was your mistake.  There was your error.  The\\nerror all \
women commit.  Why can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you women love us, faults and \
all?\\nWhy do you place us on monstrous pedestals?  We have all feet of clay,\
\\nwomen as well as men; but when we men love women, we love them \
knowing\\ntheir weaknesses, their follies, their imperfections, love them all \
the\\nmore, it may be, for that reason.  It is not the perfect, but \
the\\nimperfect, who have need of love.  It is when we are wounded by our own\
\\nhands, or by the hands of others, that love should come to cure us\
\[LongDash]else\\nwhat use is love at all?  All sins, except a sin against \
itself, Love\\nshould forgive.  All lives, save loveless lives, true Love \
should pardon.\\nA man\[CloseCurlyQuote]s love is like that.  It is wider, \
larger, more human than a\\nwoman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s.  Women think that they \
are making ideals of men.  What they are\\nmaking of us are false idols \
merely.  You made your false idol of me, and\\nI had not the courage to come \
down, show you my wounds, tell you my\\nweaknesses.  I was afraid that I \
might lose your love, as I have lost it\\nnow.  And so, last night you ruined \
my life for me\[LongDash]yes, ruined it!  What\\nthis woman asked of me was \
nothing compared to what she offered to me.\\nShe offered security, peace, \
stability.  The sin of my youth, that I had\\nthought was buried, rose up in \
front of me, hideous, horrible, with its\\nhands at my throat.  I could have \
killed it for ever, sent it back into\\nits tomb, destroyed its record, \
burned the one witness against me.  You\\nprevented me.  No one but you, you \
know it.  And now what is there before\\nme but public disgrace, ruin, \
terrible shame, the mockery of the world, a\\nlonely dishonoured life, a \
lonely dishonoured death, it may be, some day?\\nLet women make no more \
ideals of men! let them not put them on alters and\\nbow before them, or they \
may ruin other lives as completely as you\[LongDash]you\\nwhom I have so \
wildly loved\[LongDash]have ruined mine!\\n\\n[_He passes from the room_.  \

_cane_, _and cape_, _and\\npresents new buttonhole on salver_.]\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person\\nof the \
smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.\\n\\nPHIPPS. \
 Yes, my lord.  I have observed that,\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Taking out old \
buttonhole_.]  You see, Phipps, Fashion is\\nwhat one wears oneself.  What is \
unfashionable is what other people wear.\\n\\nPHIPPS.  Yes, my \
lord.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other \
people.\\n\\nPHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Putting in a new \
buttonhole_.]  And falsehoods the truths\\nof other people.\\n\\nPHIPPS.  \
Yes, my lord.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Other people are quite dreadful.  The only \
possible society\\nis oneself.\\n\\nPHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong \
romance,\\nPhipps.\\n\\nPHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Looking \
at himself in the glass_.]  Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think I quite\\nlike this \
buttonhole, Phipps.  Makes me look a little too old.  Makes me\\nalmost in \
the prime of life, eh, Phipps?\\n\\nPHIPPS.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t observe \
any alteration in your lordship\[CloseCurlyQuote]s appearance.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  You don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t, Phipps?\\n\\nPHIPPS.  No, my \
lord.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I am not quite sure.  For the future a more \
trivial\\nbuttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings.\\n\\nPHIPPS.  I will \
speak to the florist, my lord.  She has had a loss in her\\nfamily lately, \
which perhaps accounts for the lack of triviality your\\nlordship complains \
of in the buttonhole.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Extraordinary thing about the lower \
classes in England\[LongDash]they\\nare always losing their \
relations.\\n\\nPHIPPS.  Yes, my lord!  They are extremely fortunate in that \
respect.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Turns round and looks at him_.  PHIPPS _remains\
\\nimpassive_.]  Hum!  Any letters, Phipps?\\n\\nPHIPPS.  Three, my lord.  \
[_Hands letters on a salver_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Takes letters_.]  Want my \
cab round in twenty minutes.\\n\\nPHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Goes towards \
door_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Holds up letter in pink envelope_.]  Ahem!  \
Phipps, when\\ndid this letter arrive?\\n\\nPHIPPS.  It was brought by hand \
just after your lordship went to the\\nclub.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  That will do. \
 [_Exit_ PHIPPS.]  Lady Chiltern\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nhandwriting on Lady \
Chiltern\[CloseCurlyQuote]s pink notepaper.  That is rather curious.\\nI \
thought Robert was to write.  Wonder what Lady Chiltern has got to say\\nto \
me?  [_Sits at bureau and opens letter_, _and reads it_.]  \[OpenCurlyQuote]I \
want\\nyou.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.  Gertrude.\[CloseCurlyQuote]  \
[_Puts down the\\nletter with a puzzled look_.  _Then takes it up_, _and \
reads it again\\nslowly_.]  \[OpenCurlyQuote]I want you.  I trust you.  I am \
coming to you.\[CloseCurlyQuote]  So she has\\nfound out everything!  Poor \
woman!  Poor woman!  [ _Pulls out watch and\\nlooks at it_.]  But what an \
hour to call!  Ten o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock!  I shall have to\\ngive up going \
to the Berkshires.  However, it is always nice to be\\nexpected, and not to \
arrive.  I am not expected at the Bachelors\[CloseCurlyQuote], so I\\nshall \
certainly go there.  Well, I will make her stand by her husband.\\nThat is \
the only thing for her to do.  That is the only thing for any\\nwoman to do.  \
It is the growth of the moral sense in women that makes\\nmarriage such a \
hopeless, one-sided institution.  Ten o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock.  She\\nshould \
be here soon.  I must tell Phipps I am not in to any one else.\\n[_Goes \
towards bell_]\\n\\n[_Enter_ PHIPPS.]\\n\\nPHIPPS.  Lord Caversham.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Oh, why will parents always appear at the wrong time?  \
Some\\nextraordinary mistake in nature, I suppose.  [_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]\
\\nDelighted to see you, my dear father.  [_Goes to meet him_.]\\n\\nLORD \
CAVERSHAM.  Take my cloak off.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Is it worth while, \
father?\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Of course it is worth while, sir.  Which is the \
most\\ncomfortable chair?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  This one, father.  It is the \
chair I use myself, when I\\nhave visitors.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Thank ye.  \
No draught, I hope, in this room?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  No, father.\\n\\nLORD \
CAVERSHAM.  [_Sitting down_.]  Glad to hear it.  Can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t stand\
\\ndraughts.  No draughts at home.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Good many breezes, \
father.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Eh?  Eh?  Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t understand \
what you mean.  Want to have\\na serious conversation with you, \
sir.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  My dear father!  At this hour?\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  \
Well, sir, it is only ten o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock.  What is your\\nobjection \
to the hour?  I think the hour is an admirable hour!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Well, \
the fact is, father, this is not my day for talking\\nseriously.  I am very \
sorry, but it is not my day.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  What do you mean, \
sir?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  During the Season, father, I only talk seriously on \
the\\nfirst Tuesday in every month, from four to seven.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  \
Well, make it Tuesday, sir, make it Tuesday.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  But it is \
after seven, father, and my doctor says I must\\nnot have any serious \
conversation after seven.  It makes me talk in my\\nsleep.\\n\\nLORD \
CAVERSHAM.  Talk in your sleep, sir?  What does that matter?  You\\nare not \
married.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  No, father, I am not married.\\n\\nLORD \
CAVERSHAM.  Hum!  That is what I have come to talk to you about,\\nsir.  You \
have got to get married, and at once.  Why, when I was your\\nage, sir, I had \
been an inconsolable widower for three months, and was\\nalready paying my \
addresses to your admirable mother.  Damme, sir, it is\\nyour duty to get \
married.  You can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be always living for pleasure.\\nEvery \
man of position is married nowadays.  Bachelors are not fashionable\\nany \
more.  They are a damaged lot.  Too much is known about them.  You\\nmust get \
a wife, sir.  Look where your friend Robert Chiltern has got to\\nby probity, \
hard work, and a sensible marriage with a good woman.  Why\\ndon\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you imitate him, sir?  Why don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you \
take him for your model?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I think I shall, \
father.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  I wish you would, sir.  Then I should be happy. \
 At\\npresent I make your mother\[CloseCurlyQuote]s life miserable on your \
account.  You are\\nheartless, sir, quite heartless.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I \
hope not, father.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  And it is high time for you to get \
married.  You are\\nthirty-four years of age, sir.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Yes, \
father, but I only admit to thirty-two\[LongDash]thirty-one and\\na half when \
I have a really good buttonhole.  This buttonhole is not . . .\\ntrivial \
enough.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  I tell you you are thirty-four, sir.  And there \
is a\\ndraught in your room, besides, which makes your conduct worse.  Why \
did\\nyou tell me there was no draught, sir?  I feel a draught, sir, I feel \
it\\ndistinctly.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  So do I, father.  It is a dreadful \
draught.  I will come\\nand see you to-morrow, father.  We can talk over \
anything you like.  Let\\nme help you on with your cloak, father.\\n\\nLORD \
CAVERSHAM.  No, sir; I have called this evening for a definite\\npurpose, and \
I am going to see it through at all costs to my health or\\nyours.  Put down \
my cloak, sir.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Certainly, father.  But let us go into \
another room.\\n[_Rings bell_.]  There is a dreadful draught here.  [_Enter_ \
PHIPPS.]\\nPhipps, is there a good fire in the smoking-room?\\n\\nPHIPPS.  \
Yes, my lord.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Come in there, father.  Your sneezes are \
quite\\nheartrending.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir, I suppose I have a \
right to sneeze when I\\nchoose?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Apologetically_.]  \
Quite so, father.  I was merely\\nexpressing sympathy.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  \
Oh, damn sympathy.  There is a great deal too much of\\nthat sort of thing \
going on nowadays.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I quite agree with you, father.  If \
there was less sympathy\\nin the world there would be less trouble in the \
world.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Going towards the smoking-room_.]  That is a \
paradox,\\nsir.  I hate paradoxes.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  So do I, father.  \
Everybody one meets is a paradox\\nnowadays.  It is a great bore.  It makes \
society so obvious.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Turning round_, _and looking at \
his son beneath his\\nbushy eyebrows_.]  Do you always really understand what \
you say, sir?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_After some hesitation_.]  Yes, father, if \
I listen\\nattentively.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Indignantly_.]  If you listen \
attentively! . . .\\nConceited young puppy!\\n\\n[_Goes off grumbling into \
the smoking-room_.  PHIPPS _enters_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Phipps, there is a \
lady coming to see me this evening on\\nparticular business.  Show her into \
the drawing-room when she arrives.\\nYou understand?\\n\\nPHIPPS.  Yes, my \
lord.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  It is a matter of the gravest importance, Phipps.\\n\
\\nPHIPPS.  I understand, my lord.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  No one else is to be \
admitted, under any circumstances.\\n\\nPHIPPS.  I understand, my lord.  \
[_Bell rings_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Ah! that is probably the lady.  I shall \
see her myself.\\n\\n[_Just as he is going towards the door_ LORD CAVERSHAM \
_enters from the\\nsmoking-room_.]\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir? am I to \
wait attendance on you?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Considerably perplexed_.]  In a \
moment, father.  Do\\nexcuse me.  [LORD CAVERSHAM _goes back_.]  Well, \
remember my\\ninstructions, Phipps\[LongDash]into that room.\\n\\nPHIPPS.  \
Yes, my lord.\\n\\n[LORD GORING _goes into the smoking-room_.  HAROLD, _the \
footman shows_\\nMRS. CHEVELEY _in_.  _Lamia-like_, _she is in green and \
silver_.  _She\\nhas a cloak of black satin_, _lined with dead rose-leaf \
silk_.]\\n\\nHAROLD.  What name, madam?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_To_ PHIPPS, \
_who advances towards her_.]  Is Lord\\nGoring not here?  I was told he was \
at home?\\n\\nPHIPPS.  His lordship is engaged at present with Lord \
Caversham, madam.\\n\\n[_Turns a cold_, _glassy eye on_ HAROLD, _who at once \
retires_.]\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_To herself_.]  How very \
filial!\\n\\nPHIPPS.  His lordship told me to ask you, madam, to be kind \
enough to\\nwait in the drawing-room for him.  His lordship will come to you \
there.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_With a look of surprise_.]  Lord Goring expects \
me?\\n\\nPHIPPS.  Yes, madam.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Are you quite \
sure?\\n\\nPHIPPS.  His lordship told me that if a lady called I was to ask \
her to\\nwait in the drawing-room.  [_Goes to the door of the drawing-room \
and\\nopens it_.]  His lordship\[CloseCurlyQuote]s directions on the subject \
were very precise.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_To herself_]  How thoughtful of \
him!  To expect the\\nunexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect.  [_Goes \
towards the\\ndrawing-room and looks in_.]  Ugh!  How dreary a bachelor\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s drawing-room\\nalways looks.  I shall have to alter all \
this.  [PHIPPS _brings the lamp\\nfrom the writing-table_.]  No, I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t care for that lamp.  It is far too\\nglaring.  Light some \
candles.\\n\\nPHIPPS.  [_Replaces lamp_.]  Certainly, madam.\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  I hope the candles have very becoming shades.\\n\\nPHIPPS.  We \
have had no complaints about them, madam, as yet.\\n\\n[_Passes into the \
drawing-room and begins to light the candles_.]\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_To \
herself_.]  I wonder what woman he is waiting for\\nto-night.  It will be \
delightful to catch him.  Men always look so silly\\nwhen they are caught.  \
And they are always being caught.  [_Looks about\\nroom and approaches the \
writing-table_.]  What a very interesting room!\\nWhat a very interesting \
picture!  Wonder what his correspondence is like.\\n[_Takes up letters_.]  \
Oh, what a very uninteresting correspondence!\\nBills and cards, debts and \
dowagers!  Who on earth writes to him on pink\\npaper?  How silly to write on \
pink paper!  It looks like the beginning of\\na middle-class romance.  \
Romance should never begin with sentiment.  It\\nshould begin with science \
and end with a settlement.  [_Puts letter\\ndown_, _then takes it up again_.] \
 I know that handwriting.  That is\\nGertrude Chiltern\[CloseCurlyQuote]s.  I \
remember it perfectly.  The ten commandments in\\nevery stroke of the pen, \
and the moral law all over the page.  Wonder\\nwhat Gertrude is writing to \
him about?  Something horrid about me, I\\nsuppose.  How I detest that woman! \
 [_Reads it_.]  \[OpenCurlyQuote]I trust you.  I want\\nyou.  I am coming to \
you.  Gertrude.\[CloseCurlyQuote]  \[OpenCurlyQuote]I trust you.  I want you. \
 I am\\ncoming to you.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n[_A look of triumph comes over \
her face_.  _She is just about to steal\\nthe letter_, _when_ PHIPPS _comes \
in_.]\\n\\nPHIPPS.  The candles in the drawing-room are lit, madam, as you \
directed.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Thank you.  [_Rises hastily and slips the \
letter under a\\nlarge silver-cased blotting-book that is lying on the \
table_.]\\n\\nPHIPPS.  I trust the shades will be to your liking, madam.  \
They are the\\nmost becoming we have.  They are the same as his lordship uses \
himself\\nwhen he is dressing for dinner.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_With a \
smile_.]  Then I am sure they will be perfectly\\nright.\\n\\nPHIPPS.  \
[_Gravely_.]  Thank you, madam.\\n\\n[MRS. CHEVELEY _goes into the \
drawing-room_.  PHIPPS _closes the door and\\nretires_.  _The door is then \
slowly opened_, _and_ MRS. CHEVELEY _comes\\nout and creeps stealthily \
towards the writing-table_.  _Suddenly voices\\nare heard from the \
smoking-room_.  MRS. CHEVELEY _grows pale_, _and\\nstops_.  _The voices grow \
louder_, _and she goes back into the\\ndrawing-room_, _biting her \
lip_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD GORING _and_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
[_Expostulating_.]  My dear father, if I am to get married,\\nsurely you will \
allow me to choose the time, place, and person?\\nParticularly the person.\\n\
\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Testily_.]  That is a matter for me, sir.  You \
would\\nprobably make a very poor choice.  It is I who should be consulted, \
not\\nyou.  There is property at stake.  It is not a matter for \
affection.\\nAffection comes later on in married life.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
Yes.  In married life affection comes when people\\nthoroughly dislike each \
other, father, doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t it?  [_Puts on_ LORD\\nCAVERSHAM\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]S _cloak for him_.]\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Certainly, sir.  \
I mean certainly not, air.  You are\\ntalking very foolishly to-night.  What \
I say is that marriage is a matter\\nfor common sense.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  But \
women who have common sense are so curiously plain,\\nfather, aren\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t they?  Of course I only speak from hearsay.\\n\\nLORD \
CAVERSHAM.  No woman, plain or pretty, has any common sense at all,\\nsir.  \
Common sense is the privilege of our sex.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Quite so.  And \
we men are so self-sacrificing that we never\\nuse it, do we, \
father?\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  I use it, sir.  I use nothing else.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  So my mother tells me.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  It is the secret of \
your mother\[CloseCurlyQuote]s happiness.  You are\\nvery heartless, sir, \
very heartless.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I hope not, father.\\n\\n[_Goes out for a \
moment_.  _Then returns_, _looking rather put out_,\\n_with_ SIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  My dear Arthur, what a piece of good \
luck meeting\\nyou on the doorstep!  Your servant had just told me you were \
not at home.\\nHow extraordinary!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  The fact is, I am \
horribly busy to-night, Robert, and I\\ngave orders I was not at home to any \
one.  Even my father had a\\ncomparatively cold reception.  He complained of \
a draught the whole time.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Ah! you must be at home \
to me, Arthur.  You are my\\nbest friend.  Perhaps by to-morrow you will be \
my only friend.  My wife\\nhas discovered everything.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Ah! \
I guessed as much!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Looking at him_.]  Really!  \
How?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_After some hesitation_.]  Oh, merely by something \
in the\\nexpression of your face as you came in.  Who told her?\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  Mrs. Cheveley herself.  And the woman I love knows\\nthat I \
began my career with an act of low dishonesty, that I built up my\\nlife upon \
sands of shame\[LongDash]that I sold, like a common huckster, the \
secret\\nthat had been intrusted to me as a man of honour.  I thank heaven \
poor\\nLord Radley died without knowing that I betrayed him.  I would to God \
I\\nhad died before I had been so horribly tempted, or had fallen so \
low.\\n[_Burying his face in his hands_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_After a \
pause_.]  You have heard nothing from Vienna yet,\\nin answer to your \
wire?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Looking up_.]  Yes; I got a telegram from \
the\\nfirst secretary at eight o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock to-night.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Well?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Nothing is absolutely known against \
her.  On the\\ncontrary, she occupies a rather high position in society.  It \
is a sort\\nof open secret that Baron Arnheim left her the greater portion of \
his\\nimmense fortune.  Beyond that I can learn nothing.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
She doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t turn out to be a spy, then?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  Oh! spies are of no use nowadays.  Their profession\\nis over.  \
The newspapers do their work instead.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  And thunderingly \
well they do it.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Arthur, I am parched with thirst. \
 May I ring for\\nsomething?  Some hock and seltzer?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
Certainly.  Let me.  [_Rings the bell_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Thanks!  \
I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know what to do, Arthur, I \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nknow what to do, and you are my only friend.  But \
what a friend you\\nare\[LongDash]the one friend I can trust.  I can trust \
you absolutely, can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t I?\\n\\n[_Enter_ PHIPPS.]\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  My dear Robert, of course.  Oh!  [_To_ PHIPPS.]  Bring some\\nhock \
and seltzer.\\n\\nPHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  And \
Phipps!\\n\\nPHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Will you excuse me for \
a moment, Robert?  I want to give\\nsome directions to my servant.\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  Certainly.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  When that lady calls, tell \
her that I am not expected home\\nthis evening.  Tell her that I have been \
suddenly called out of town.\\nYou understand?\\n\\nPHIPPS.  The lady is in \
that room, my lord.  You told me to show her into\\nthat room, my \
lord.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  You did perfectly right.  [_Exit_ PHIPPS.]  What a \
mess I\\nam in.  No; I think I shall get through it.  I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll \
give her a lecture\\nthrough the door.  Awkward thing to manage, \
though.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Arthur, tell me what I should do.  My life \
seems to\\nhave crumbled about me.  I am a ship without a rudder in a night \
without\\na star.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Robert, you love your wife, don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I love her more than \
anything in the world.  I used\\nto think ambition the great thing.  It is \
not.  Love is the great thing\\nin the world.  There is nothing but love, and \
I love her.  But I am\\ndefamed in her eyes.  I am ignoble in her eyes.  \
There is a wide gulf\\nbetween us now.  She has found me out, Arthur, she has \
found me out.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Has she never in her life done some folly\
\[LongDash]some\\nindiscretion\[LongDash]that she should not forgive your \
sin?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  My wife!  Never!  She does not know what \
weakness\\nor temptation is.  I am of clay like other men.  She stands apart \
as good\\nwomen do\[LongDash]pitiless in her perfection\[LongDash]cold and \
stern and without mercy.\\nBut I love her, Arthur.  We are childless, and I \
have no one else to\\nlove, no one else to love me.  Perhaps if God had sent \
us children she\\nmight have been kinder to me.  But God has given us a \
lonely house.  And\\nshe has cut my heart in two.  Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t let \
us talk of it.  I was brutal to\\nher this evening.  But I suppose when \
sinners talk to saints they are\\nbrutal always.  I said to her things that \
were hideously true, on my\\nside, from my stand-point, from the standpoint \
of men.  But don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t let us\\ntalk of that.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
Your wife will forgive you.  Perhaps at this moment she is\\nforgiving you.  \
She loves you, Robert.  Why should she not forgive?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN. \
 God grant it!  God grant it!  [_Buries his face in\\nhis hands_.]  But there \
is something more I have to tell you, Arthur.\\n\\n[_Enter_ PHIPPS _with \
drinks_.]\\n\\nPHIPPS.  [_Hands hock and seltzer to_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]  \
Hock and\\nseltzer, sir.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Thank you.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Is your carriage here, Robert?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  No; I \
walked from the club.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Sir Robert will take my cab, Phipps.\
\\n\\nPHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Exit_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Robert, you don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mind my sending you away?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
Arthur, you must let me stay for five minutes.  I\\nhave made up my mind what \
I am going to do to-night in the House.  The\\ndebate on the Argentine Canal \
is to begin at eleven.  [_A chair falls in\\nthe drawing-room_.]  What is \
that?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Nothing.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I heard a chair \
fall in the next room.  Some one\\nhas been listening.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  No, \
no; there is no one there.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  There is some one.  \
There are lights in the room,\\nand the door is ajar.  Some one has been \
listening to every secret of my\\nlife.  Arthur, what does this \
mean?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Robert, you are excited, unnerved.  I tell you there \
is no\\none in that room. Sit down, Robert.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Do you \
give me your word that there is no one\\nthere?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
Yes.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Your word of honour?  [_Sits \
down_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Yes.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Rises_.]  \
Arthur, let me see for myself.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  No, no.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  If there is no one there why should I not look in\\nthat room?  \
Arthur, you must let me go into that room and satisfy myself.\\nLet me know \
that no eavesdropper has heard my life\[CloseCurlyQuote]s secret.  Arthur, \
you\\ndon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t realise what I am going through.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Robert, this must stop.  I have told you that there is no\\none in \
that room\[LongDash]that is enough.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Rushes to \
the door of the room_.]  It is not\\nenough.  I insist on going into this \
room.  You have told me there is no\\none there, so what reason can you have \
for refusing me?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  For God\[CloseCurlyQuote]s sake, don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t!  There is some one there.  Some one\\nwhom you must not \
see.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Ah, I thought so!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I forbid \
you to enter that room.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Stand back.  My life is at \
stake.  And I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t care\\nwho is there.  I will know who it \
is to whom I have told my secret and my\\nshame.  [_Enters room_.]\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Great heavens! his own wife!\\n\\n[SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _comes back_, \
_with a look of scorn and anger on his\\nface_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
What explanation have you to give me for the\\npresence of that woman \
here?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Robert, I swear to you on my honour that that lady \
is\\nstainless and guiltless of all offence towards you.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  She is a vile, an infamous thing!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t say that, Robert!  It was for your sake she came\\nhere.  \
It was to try and save you she came here.  She loves you and no\\none \
else.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You are mad.  What have I to do with her \
intrigues\\nwith you?  Let her remain your mistress!  You are well suited to \
each\\nother.  She, corrupt and shameful\[LongDash]you, false as a friend, \
treacherous as\\nan enemy even\[LongDash]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  It is not true, \
Robert.  Before heaven, it is not true.  In\\nher presence and in yours I \
will explain all.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Let me pass, sir.  You have lied \
enough upon your\\nword of honour.\\n\\n[SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _goes out_.  \
LORD GORING _rushes to the door of the\\ndrawing-room_, _when_ MRS. CHEVELEY \
_comes out_, _looking radiant and\\nmuch amused_.]\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
[_With a mock curtsey_]  Good evening, Lord Goring!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Mrs. \
Cheveley!  Great heavens! . . . May I ask what you\\nwere doing in my \
drawing-room?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Merely listening.  I have a perfect \
passion for listening\\nthrough keyholes.  One always hears such wonderful \
things through them.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t that sound \
rather like tempting Providence?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh! surely Providence \
can resist temptation by this time.\\n[_Makes a sign to him to take her cloak \
off_, _which he does_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I am glad you have called.  I am \
going to give you some\\ngood advice.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh! pray don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t.  One should never give a woman anything\\nthat she can\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t wear in the evening.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I see you are \
quite as wilful as you used to be.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Far more!  I have \
greatly improved.  I have had more\\nexperience.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Too much \
experience is a dangerous thing.  Pray have a\\ncigarette.  Half the pretty \
women in London smoke cigarettes.  Personally\\nI prefer the other \
half.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.  I never smoke.  My dressmaker wouldn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like it,\\nand a woman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s first duty in \
life is to her dressmaker, isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t it?  What\\nthe second duty \
is, no one has as yet discovered.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  You have come here to \
sell me Robert Chiltern\[CloseCurlyQuote]s letter,\\nhaven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
you?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  To offer it to you on conditions.  How did you \
guess\\nthat?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Because you haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
mentioned the subject.  Have you got it\\nwith you?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
[_Sitting down_.]  Oh, no!  A well-made dress has no\\npockets.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  What is your price for it?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  How absurdly English \
you are!  The English think that a\\ncheque-book can solve every problem in \
life.  Why, my dear Arthur, I have\\nvery much more money than you have, and \
quite as much as Robert Chiltern\\nhas got hold of.  Money is not what I \
want.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  What do you want then, Mrs. Cheveley?\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  Why don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you call me Laura?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like the name.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  You used to adore \
it.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Yes: that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s why.  [MRS. CHEVELEY \
_motions to him to sit\\ndown beside her_.  _He smiles_, _and does \
so_.]\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Arthur, you loved me once.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Yes.\
\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  And you asked me to be your wife.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
That was the natural result of my loving you.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  And you \
threw me over because you saw, or said you saw,\\npoor old Lord Mortlake \
trying to have a violent flirtation with me in the\\nconservatory at \
Tenby.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I am under the impression that my lawyer settled \
that\\nmatter with you on certain terms . . . dictated by yourself.\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  At that time I was poor; you were rich.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Quite \
so.  That is why you pretended to love me.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Shrugging \
her shoulders_.]  Poor old Lord Mortlake, who\\nhad only two topics of \
conversation, his gout and his wife!  I never\\ncould quite make out which of \
the two he was talking about.  He used the\\nmost horrible language about \
them both.  Well, you were silly, Arthur.\\nWhy, Lord Mortlake was never \
anything more to me than an amusement.  One\\nof those utterly tedious \
amusements one only finds at an English country\\nhouse on an English country \
Sunday.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think any one at all morally\\nresponsible \
for what he or she does at an English country house.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Yes.  \
I know lots of people think that.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I loved you, \
Arthur.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  My dear Mrs. Cheveley, you have always been far \
too clever\\nto know anything about love.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I did love \
you.  And you loved me.  You know you loved\\nme; and love is a very \
wonderful thing.  I suppose that when a man has\\nonce loved a woman, he will \
do anything for her, except continue to love\\nher?  [_Puts her hand on \
his_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Taking his hand away quietly_.]  Yes: except \
that.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_After a pause_.]  I am tired of living abroad.  \
I want\\nto come back to London.  I want to have a charming house here.  I \
want to\\nhave a salon.  If one could only teach the English how to talk, and \
the\\nIrish how to listen, society here would be quite civilised.  Besides, I\
\\nhave arrived at the romantic stage.  When I saw you last night at \
the\\nChilterns\[CloseCurlyQuote], I knew you were the only person I had ever \
cared for, if I\\never have cared for anybody, Arthur.  And so, on the \
morning of the day\\nyou marry me, I will give you Robert Chiltern\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s letter.  That is my\\noffer.  I will give it to you now, \
if you promise to marry me.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Now?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
[_Smiling_.]  To-morrow.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Are you really serious?\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  Yes, quite serious.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I should make you a very \
bad husband.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mind bad husbands. \
 I have had two.  They amused\\nme immensely.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  You mean \
that you amused yourself immensely, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you?\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  What do you know about my married life?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
Nothing: but I can read it like a book.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  What \
book?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Rising_.]  The Book of Numbers.\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  Do you think it is quite charming of you to be so rude to\\na \
woman in your own house?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  In the case of very fascinating \
women, sex is a challenge,\\nnot a defence.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I suppose \
that is meant for a compliment.  My dear\\nArthur, women are never disarmed \
by compliments.  Men always are.  That\\nis the difference between the two \
sexes.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Women are never disarmed by anything, as far as I \
know\\nthem.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_After a pause_.]  Then you are going to \
allow your\\ngreatest friend, Robert Chiltern, to be ruined, rather than \
marry some\\none who really has considerable attractions left.  I thought you \
would\\nhave risen to some great height of self-sacrifice, Arthur.  I think \
you\\nshould.  And the rest of your life you could spend in contemplating \
your\\nown perfections.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Oh! I do that as it is.  And \
self-sacrifice is a thing that\\nshould be put down by law.  It is so \
demoralising to the people for whom\\none sacrifices oneself.  They always go \
to the bad.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  As if anything could demoralise Robert \
Chiltern!  You\\nseem to forget that I know his real character.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  What you know about him is not his real character.  It was\\nan act \
of folly done in his youth, dishonourable, I admit, shameful, I\\nadmit, \
unworthy of him, I admit, and therefore . . . not his \
true\\ncharacter.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  How you men stand up for each \
other!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  How you women war against each other!\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  [_Bitterly_.]  I only war against one woman, against\\nGertrude \
Chiltern.  I hate her.  I hate her now more than ever.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
Because you have brought a real tragedy into her life, I\\nsuppose.\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  [_With a sneer_.]  Oh, there is only one real tragedy in\\na woman\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s life.  The fact that her past is always her lover, and \
her\\nfuture invariably her husband.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern knows \
nothing of the kind of life to which\\nyou are alluding.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
A woman whose size in gloves is seven and three-quarters\\nnever knows much \
about anything.  You know Gertrude has always worn seven\\nand \
three-quarters?  That is one of the reasons why there was never any\\nmoral \
sympathy between us. . . . Well, Arthur, I suppose this romantic\\ninterview \
may be regarded as at an end.  You admit it was romantic, don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nyou?  For the privilege of being your wife I was ready \
to surrender a\\ngreat prize, the climax of my diplomatic career.  You \
decline.  Very\\nwell.  If Sir Robert doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t uphold my \
Argentine scheme, I expose him.\\nVoil\[AGrave] tout.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  You \
mustn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t do that.  It would be vile, horrible, \
infamous.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Shrugging her shoulders_.]  Oh! don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t use big words.\\nThey mean so little.  It is a commercial \
transaction.  That is all.\\nThere is no good mixing up sentimentality in it. \
 I offered to sell\\nRobert Chiltern a certain thing.  If he won\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t pay me my price, he will\\nhave to pay the world a \
greater price.  There is no more to be said.  I\\nmust go.  Good-bye.  Won\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you shake hands?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  With you?  No.  Your \
transaction with Robert Chiltern may\\npass as a loathsome commercial \
transaction of a loathsome commercial age;\\nbut you seem to have forgotten \
that you came here to-night to talk of\\nlove, you whose lips desecrated the \
word love, you to whom the thing is a\\nbook closely sealed, went this \
afternoon to the house of one of the most\\nnoble and gentle women in the \
world to degrade her husband in her eyes,\\nto try and kill her love for him, \
to put poison in her heart, and\\nbitterness in her life, to break her idol, \
and, it may be, spoil her\\nsoul.  That I cannot forgive you.  That was \
horrible.  For that there can\\nbe no forgiveness.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
Arthur, you are unjust to me.  Believe me, you are quite\\nunjust to me.  I \
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t go to taunt Gertrude at all.  I had no idea \
of\\ndoing anything of the kind when I entered.  I called with Lady \
Markby\\nsimply to ask whether an ornament, a jewel, that I lost somewhere \
last\\nnight, had been found at the Chilterns\[CloseCurlyQuote].  If you don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe me, you\\ncan ask Lady Markby.  She will tell you \
it is true.  The scene that\\noccurred happened after Lady Markby had left, \
and was really forced on me\\nby Gertrude\[CloseCurlyQuote]s rudeness and \
sneers.  I called, oh!\[LongDash]a little out of malice\\nif you like\
\[LongDash]but really to ask if a diamond brooch of mine had been \
found.\\nThat was the origin of the whole thing.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  A diamond \
snake-brooch with a ruby?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  How do you \
know?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Because it is found.  In point of fact, I found it \
myself,\\nand stupidly forgot to tell the butler anything about it as I \
was\\nleaving.  [_Goes over to the writing-table and pulls out the drawers_.]\
\\nIt is in this drawer.  No, that one.  This is the brooch, isn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t it?\\n[_Holds up the brooch_.]\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  \
I am so glad to get it back.  It was . . a present.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Won\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you wear it?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Certainly, if you pin \
it in.  [LORD GORING _suddenly\\nclasps it on her arm_.]  Why do you put it \
on as a bracelet?  I never\\nknew it could he worn as a bracelet.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Really?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Holding out her handsome arm_.]  No; \
but it looks very\\nwell on me as a bracelet, doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t it?\\n\
\\nLORD GORING.  Yes; much better than when I saw it last.\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  When did you see it last?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Calmly_.]  Oh, ten \
years ago, on Lady Berkshire, from\\nwhom you stole it.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
[_Starting_.]  What do you mean?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I mean that you stole \
that ornament from my cousin, Mary\\nBerkshire, to whom I gave it when she \
was married.  Suspicion fell on a\\nwretched servant, who was sent away in \
disgrace.  I recognised it last\\nnight.  I determined to say nothing about \
it till I had found the thief.\\nI have found the thief now, and I have heard \
her own confession.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Tossing her head_.]  It is not \
true.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  You know it is true.  Why, thief is written across \
your\\nface at this moment.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I will deny the whole affair \
from beginning to end.  I\\nwill say that I have never seen this wretched \
thing, that it was never in\\nmy possession.\\n\\n[MRS. CHEVELEY _tries to \
get the bracelet off her arm_, _but fails_.\\nLORD GORING _looks on amused_.  \
_Her thin fingers tear at the jewel to no\\npurpose_.  _A curse breaks from \
her_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  The drawback of stealing a thing, Mrs. Cheveley, is \
that\\none never knows how wonderful the thing that one steals is.  You can\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nget that bracelet off, unless you know where the spring \
is.  And I see\\nyou don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know where the spring is.  It is \
rather difficult to find.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  You brute!  You coward!  [_She \
tries again to unclasp the\\nbracelet_, _but fails_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Oh! \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t use big words.  They mean so little.\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  [_Again tears at the bracelet in a paroxysm of rage_,\\n_with \
inarticulate sounds_.  _Then stops_, _and looks at_ LORD GORING.]\\nWhat are \
you going to do?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I am going to ring for my servant.  He is \
an admirable\\nservant.  Always comes in the moment one rings for him.  When \
he comes I\\nwill tell him to fetch the police.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
[_Trembling_.]  The police?  What for?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  To-morrow the \
Berkshires will prosecute you.  That is what\\nthe police are for.\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  [_Is now in an agony of physical terror_.  _Her face \
is\\ndistorted_.  _Her mouth awry_.  _A mask has fallen from her_.  _She it_,\
\\n_for the moment_, _dreadful to look at_.]  Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t do that. \
 I will do\\nanything you want.  Anything in the world you want.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Give me Robert Chiltern\[CloseCurlyQuote]s letter.\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  Stop! Stop!  Let me have time to think.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Give me \
Robert Chiltern\[CloseCurlyQuote]s letter.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I have not \
got it with me.  I will give it to you\\nto-morrow.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  You \
know you are lying.  Give it to me at once.  [MRS.\\nCHEVELEY _pulls the \
letter out_, _and hands it to him_.  _She is horribly\\npale_.]  This is \
it?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_In a hoarse voice_.]  Yes.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
[_Takes the letter_, _examines it_, _sighs_, _and burns it\\nwith the lamp_.] \
 For so well-dressed a woman, Mrs. Cheveley, you have\\nmoments of admirable \
common sense.  I congratulate you.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Catches sight of_ \
LADY CHILTERN\[CloseCurlyQuote]S _letter_, _the cover\\nof which is just \
showing from under the blotting-book_.]  Please get me a\\nglass of water.\\n\
\\nLORD GORING.  Certainly.  [_Goes to the corner of the room and pours \
out\\na glass of water_.  _While his back is turned_ MRS. CHEVELEY \
_steals_\\nLADY CHILTERN\[CloseCurlyQuote]S _letter_.  _When_ LORD GORING \
_returns the glass she\\nrefuses it with a gesture_.]\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \
Thank you.  Will you help me on with my cloak?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  With \
pleasure.  [_Puts her cloak on_.]\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.  I am never \
going to try to harm Robert Chiltern\\nagain.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Fortunately \
you have not the chance, Mrs. Cheveley.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Well, if even I \
had the chance, I wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t.  On the\\ncontrary, I am going \
to render him a great service.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I am charmed to hear it.  \
It is a reformation.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t bear \
so upright a gentleman, so honourable\\nan English gentleman, being so \
shamefully deceived, and so\[LongDash]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Well?\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  I find that somehow Gertrude Chiltern\[CloseCurlyQuote]s dying \
speech and\\nconfession has strayed into my pocket.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  What \
do you mean?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_With a bitter note of triumph in her \
voice_.]  I mean\\nthat I am going to send Robert Chiltern the love-letter \
his wife wrote to\\nyou to-night.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Love-letter?\\n\\nMRS. \
CHEVELEY.  [_Laughing_.]  \[OpenCurlyQuote]I want you.  I trust you.  I am \
coming to\\nyou.  Gertrude.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n[LORD GORING _rushes to \
the bureau and takes up the envelope_, _finds is\\nempty_, _and turns \
round_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  You wretched woman, must you always be thieving?  \
Give me\\nback that letter.  I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll take it from you by force. \
 You shall not leave\\nmy room till I have got it.\\n\\n[_He rushes towards \
her_, _but_ MRS. CHEVELEY _at once puts her hand on\\nthe electric bell that \
is on the table_. _The bell sounds with shrill\\nreverberations_, _and_ \
PHIPPS _enters_.]\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  [_After a pause_.]  Lord Goring merely \
rang that you\\nshould show me out.  Good-night, Lord Goring!\\n\\n[_Goes out \
followed by_ PHIPPS.  _Her face is illumined with evil\\ntriumph_.  _There is \

\\nFOURTH ACT\\n\\n\\nSCENE\\n\\n\\n_Same as Act II_.\\n\\n[LORD GORING _is \
standing by the fireplace with his hands in his\\npockets_.  _He is looking \
rather bored_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, \
_and rings the\\nbell_.]  It is a great nuisance.  I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
find any one in this house to\\ntalk to.  And I am full of interesting \
information.  I feel like the\\nlatest edition of something or \
other.\\n\\n[_Enter servant_.]\\n\\nJAMES.  Sir Robert is still at the \
Foreign Office, my lord.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern not down \
yet?\\n\\nJAMES.  Her ladyship has not yet left her room.  Miss Chiltern has \
just\\ncome in from riding.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_To himself_.]  Ah! that is \
something.\\n\\nJAMES.  Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the \
library for Sir\\nRobert.  I told him your lordship was here.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Thank you!  Would you kindly tell him I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve gone?\\n\
\\nJAMES.  [_Bowing_.]  I shall do so, my lord.\\n\\n[_Exit \
servant_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Really, I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to meet \
my father three days running.\\nIt is a great deal too much excitement for \
any son.  I hope to goodness\\nhe won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t come up.  Fathers \
should be neither seen nor heard.  That is the\\nonly proper basis for family \
life.  Mothers are different.  Mothers are\\ndarlings.  [_Throws himself down \
into a chair_, _picks up a paper and\\nbegins to read it_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ \
LORD CAVERSHAM.]\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir, what are you doing here?  \
Wasting your time\\nas usual, I suppose?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Throws down \
paper and rises_.]  My dear father, when one\\npays a visit it is for the \
purpose of wasting other people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s time, not\\none\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s own.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Have you been thinking over \
what I spoke to you about\\nlast night?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I have been \
thinking about nothing else.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Engaged to be married yet?\
\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Genially_.]  Not yet: but I hope to be before \
lunch-time.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Caustically_.]  You can have till \
dinner-time if it\\nwould be of any convenience to you.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
Thanks awfully, but I think I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d sooner be engaged \
before\\nlunch.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Humph!  Never know when you are serious \
or not.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Neither do I, father.\\n\\n[_A pause_.]\\n\\nLORD \
CAVERSHAM.  I suppose you have read _The Times_ this morning?\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  [_Airily_.]  The Times?  Certainly not.  I only read _The\\nMorning \
Post_.  All that one should know about modern life is where the\\nDuchesses \
are; anything else is quite demoralising.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Do you mean \
to say you have not read _The Times_ leading\\narticle on Robert Chiltern\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s career?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Good heavens!  No.  What does \
it say?\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  What should it say, sir?  Everything \
complimentary, of\\ncourse.  Chiltern\[CloseCurlyQuote]s speech last night on \
this Argentine Canal scheme was\\none of the finest pieces of oratory ever \
delivered in the House since\\nCanning.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Ah!  Never heard \
of Canning.  Never wanted to.  And did . . .\\ndid Chiltern uphold the \
scheme?\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Uphold it, sir?  How little you know him!  Why, \
he\\ndenounced it roundly, and the whole system of modern political \
finance.\\nThis speech is the turning-point in his career, as _The Times_ \
points\\nout.  You should read this article, sir.  [_Opens_ The Times.]  \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Sir\\nRobert Chiltern . . . most rising of our young \
statesmen . . . Brilliant\\nOrator . . . Unblemished career . . . Well-known \
integrity of character\\n. . . Represents what is best in English public life \
. . . Noble contrast\\nto the lax morality so common among foreign \
politicians.\[CloseCurlyQuote]  They will\\nnever say that of you, \
sir.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I sincerely hope not, father.  However, I am \
delighted at\\nwhat you tell me about Robert, thoroughly delighted.  It shows \
he has got\\npluck.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  He has got more than pluck, sir, he \
has got genius.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Ah! I prefer pluck.  It is not so common, \
nowadays, as\\ngenius is.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  I wish you would go into \
Parliament.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  My dear father, only people who look dull ever \
get into the\\nHouse of Commons, and only people who are dull ever succeed \
there.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Why don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you try to do \
something useful in life?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I am far too young.\\n\\nLORD \
CAVERSHAM.  [_Testily_.]  I hate this affectation of youth, sir.  It\\nis a \
great deal too prevalent nowadays.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Youth isn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t an affectation.  Youth is an art.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  \
Why don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you propose to that pretty Miss \
Chiltern?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I am of a very nervous disposition, especially \
in the\\nmorning.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t suppose \
there is the smallest chance of her\\naccepting you.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know how the betting stands to-day.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  \
If she did accept you she would be the prettiest fool in\\nEngland.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  That is just what I should like to marry.  A thoroughly\\nsensible \
wife would reduce me to a condition of absolute idiocy in less\\nthan six \
months.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  You don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t deserve her, sir.\\n\
\\nLORD GORING.  My dear father, if we men married the women we deserved, \
we\\nshould have a very bad time of it.\\n\\n[_Enter_ MABEL \
CHILTERN.]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Oh! . . . How do you do, Lord Caversham?  I \
hope Lady\\nCaversham is quite well?\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Lady Caversham is \
as usual, as usual.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Good morning, Miss Mabel!\\n\\nMABEL \
CHILTERN.  [_Taking no notice at all of_ LORD GORING, _and\\naddressing \
herself exclusively to_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]  And Lady \
Caversham\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nbonnets . . . are they at all \
better?\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  They have had a serious relapse, I am sorry to \
say.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Good morning, Miss Mabel!\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_To_ \
LORD CAVERSHAM.]  I hope an operation will not be\\nnecessary.\\n\\nLORD \
CAVERSHAM.  [_Smiling at her pertness_.]  If it is, we shall have to\\ngive \
Lady Caversham a narcotic.  Otherwise she would never consent to\\nhave a \
feather touched.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_With increased emphasis_.]  Good \
morning, Miss Mabel!\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_Turning round with feigned \
surprise_.]  Oh, are you\\nhere?  Of course you understand that after your \
breaking your appointment\\nI am never going to speak to you again.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Oh, please don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t say such a thing.  You are the one \
person\\nin London I really like to have to listen to me.\\n\\nMABEL \
CHILTERN.  Lord Goring, I never believe a single word that either\\nyou or I \
say to each other.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  You are quite right, my dear, quite \
right . . . as far\\nas he is concerned, I mean.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Do you \
think you could possibly make your son behave a\\nlittle better occasionally? \
 Just as a change.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  I regret to say, Miss Chiltern, that \
I have no influence\\nat all over my son.  I wish I had.  If I had, I know \
what I would make\\nhim do.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  I am afraid that he has one \
of those terribly weak\\nnatures that are not susceptible to \
influence.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  He is very heartless, very \
heartless.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  It seems to me that I am a little in the way \
here.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  It is very good for you to be in the way, and to \
know\\nwhat people say of you behind your back.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t at all like knowing what people say of me behind \
my\\nback.  It makes me far too conceited.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  After that, \
my dear, I really must bid you good morning.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Oh! I hope \
you are not going to leave me all alone with\\nLord Goring?  Especially at \
such an early hour in the day.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  I am afraid I can\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t take him with me to Downing Street.\\nIt is not the Prime \
Minster\[CloseCurlyQuote]s day for seeing the unemployed.\\n\\n[_Shakes hands \
with_ MABEL CHILTERN, _takes up his hat and stick_, _and\\ngoes out_, _with a \
parting glare of indignation at_ LORD GORING.]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_Takes \
up roses and begins to arrange them in a bowl on\\nthe table_.]  People who \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t keep their appointments in the Park \
are\\nhorrid.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Detestable.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  I am glad \
you admit it.  But I wish you wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t look so\\npleased \
about it.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t help it.  I always look \
pleased when I am with you.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_Sadly_.]  Then I suppose \
it is my duty to remain with\\nyou?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Of course it \
is.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Well, my duty is a thing I never do, on principle.  \
It\\nalways depresses me.  So I am afraid I must leave you.\\n\\nLORD GORING. \
 Please don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t, Miss Mabel.  I have something very particular\
\\nto say to you.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_Rapturously_.]  Oh! is it a \
proposal?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Somewhat taken aback_.]  Well, yes, it is\
\[LongDash]I am bound to\\nsay it is.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_With a sigh of \
pleasure_.]  I am so glad.  That makes\\nthe second to-day.\\n\\nLORD GORING. \
 [_Indignantly_.]  The second to-day?  What conceited ass\\nhas been \
impertinent enough to dare to propose to you before I had\\nproposed to \
you?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Tommy Trafford, of course.  It is one of Tommy\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s days\\nfor proposing.  He always proposes on Tuesdays and \
Thursdays, during the\\nSeason.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  You \
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t accept him, I hope?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  I make it a \
rule never to accept Tommy.  That is why he\\ngoes on proposing.  Of course, \
as you didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t turn up this morning, I very\\nnearly said \
yes.  It would have been an excellent lesson both for him and\\nfor you if I \
had.  It would have taught you both better manners.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Oh! \
bother Tommy Trafford.  Tommy is a silly little ass.  I\\nlove \
you.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  I know.  And I think you might have mentioned it \
before.\\nI am sure I have given you heaps of opportunities.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Mabel, do be serious.  Please be serious.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Ah! \
that is the sort of thing a man always says to a\\ngirl before he has been \
married to her.  He never says it afterwards.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Taking \
hold of her hand_.]  Mabel, I have told you that I\\nlove you.  Can\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you love me a little in return?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  You \
silly Arthur!  If you knew anything about . . .\\nanything, which you don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t, you would know that I adore you.  Every one in\\nLondon \
knows it except you.  It is a public scandal the way I adore you.\\nI have \
been going about for the last six months telling the whole of\\nsociety that \
I adore you.  I wonder you consent to have anything to say\\nto me.  I have \
no character left at all.  At least, I feel so happy that\\nI am quite sure I \
have no character left at all.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Catches her in his arms \
and kisses her_.  _Then there is\\na pause of bliss_.]  Dear!  Do you know I \
was awfully afraid of being\\nrefused!\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_Looking up at \
him_.]  But you never have been refused\\nyet by anybody, have you, Arthur?  \
I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t imagine any one refusing you.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
[_After kissing her again_.]  Of course I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not nearly \
good\\nenough for you, Mabel.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_Nestling close to \
him_.]  I am so glad, darling.  I\\nwas afraid you were.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
[_After some hesitation_.]  And I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m . . . \
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m a little over\\nthirty.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Dear, you \
look weeks younger than that.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Enthusiastically_.]  How \
sweet of you to say so! . . .\\nAnd it is only fair to tell you frankly that \
I am fearfully extravagant.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  But so am I, Arthur.  So we\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]re sure to agree.  And now I\\nmust go and see Gertrude.\\n\
\\nLORD GORING.  Must you really?  [_Kisses her_.]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Yes.\
\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Then do tell her I want to talk to her particularly.  \
I\\nhave been waiting here all the morning to see either her or \
Robert.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Do you mean to say you didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
come here expressly to\\npropose to me?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Triumphantly_.]  \
No; that was a flash of genius.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Your first.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  [_With determination_.]  My last.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  I am \
delighted to hear it.  Now don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t stir.  \
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll be\\nback in five minutes.  And don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
fall into any temptations while I am\\naway.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Dear Mabel, \
while you are away, there are none.  It makes\\nme horribly dependent on you.\
\\n\\n[_Enter_ LADY CHILTERN.]\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Good morning, dear!  How \
pretty you are looking!\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  How pale you are looking, \
Gertrude!  It is most\\nbecoming!\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Good morning, Lord \
Goring!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Bowing_.]  Good morning, Lady \
Chiltern!\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_Aside to_ LORD GORING.]  I shall be in \
the\\nconservatory under the second palm tree on the left.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
Second on the left?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  [_With a look of mock surprise_.]  \
Yes; the usual palm\\ntree.\\n\\n[_Blows a kiss to him_, _unobserved by_ LADY \
CHILTERN, _and goes out_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern, I have a certain \
amount of very good news to\\ntell you.  Mrs. Cheveley gave me up Robert\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s letter last night, and I\\nburned it.  Robert is safe.\\n\
\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Sinking on the sofa_.]  Safe!  Oh! I am so glad \
of\\nthat.  What a good friend you are to him\[LongDash]to us!\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  There is only one person now that could be said to be in\\nany \
danger.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Who is that?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Sitting down \
beside her_.]  Yourself.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I?  In danger?  What do you \
mean?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Danger is too great a word.  It is a word I should \
not have\\nused.  But I admit I have something to tell you that may distress \
you,\\nthat terribly distresses me.  Yesterday evening you wrote me a \
very\\nbeautiful, womanly letter, asking me for my help.  You wrote to me as \
one\\nof your oldest friends, one of your husband\[CloseCurlyQuote]s oldest \
friends.  Mrs.\\nCheveley stole that letter from my rooms.\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  Well, what use is it to her?  Why should she not have \
it?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Rising_.]  Lady Chiltern, I will be quite frank with \
you.\\nMrs. Cheveley puts a certain construction on that letter and proposes \
to\\nsend it to your husband.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  But what construction \
could she put on it? . . . Oh! not\\nthat! not that!  If I in\[LongDash]in \
trouble, and wanting your help, trusting you,\\npropose to come to you . . . \
that you may advise me . . . assist me . . .\\nOh! are there women so \
horrible as that . . .?  And she proposes to send\\nit to my husband?  Tell \
me what happened.  Tell me all that happened.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Mrs. \
Cheveley was concealed in a room adjoining my library,\\nwithout my \
knowledge.  I thought that the person who was waiting in that\\nroom to see \
me was yourself.  Robert came in unexpectedly.  A chair or\\nsomething fell \
in the room.  He forced his way in, and he discovered her.\\nWe had a \
terrible scene.  I still thought it was you.  He left me in\\nanger.  At the \
end of everything Mrs. Cheveley got possession of your\\nletter\[LongDash]she \
stole it, when or how, I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  At \
what hour did this happen?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  At half-past ten.  And now I \
propose that we tell Robert\\nthe whole thing at once.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  \
[_Looking at him with amazement that is almost terror_.]\\nYou want me to \
tell Robert that the woman you expected was not Mrs.\\nCheveley, but myself?  \
That it was I whom you thought was concealed in a\\nroom in your house, at \
half-past ten o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock at night?  You want me to\\ntell him \
that?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I think it is better that he should know the exact \
truth.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Rising_.]  Oh, I couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t, I \
couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  May I do it?\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  No.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Gravely_.]  You are wrong, Lady Chiltern.\
\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  No.  The letter must be intercepted.  That is all.  But\
\\nhow can I do it?  Letters arrive for him every moment of the day.  \
His\\nsecretaries open them and hand them to him.  I dare not ask the \
servants\\nto bring me his letters.  It would be impossible.  Oh! why don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you tell\\nme what to do?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Pray be \
calm, Lady Chiltern, and answer the questions I am\\ngoing to put to you.  \
You said his secretaries open his letters.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  \
Yes.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Who is with him to-day?  Mr. Trafford, isn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t it?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  No.  Mr. Montford, I \
think.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  You can trust him?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_With a \
gesture of despair_.]  Oh! how do I know?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  He would do what \
you asked him, wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t he?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I think so.\
\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Your letter was on pink paper.  He could recognise \
it\\nwithout reading it, couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t he?  By the \
colour?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I suppose so.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Is he in the \
house now?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Then I will go and \
see him myself, and tell him that a\\ncertain letter, written on pink paper, \
is to be forwarded to Robert\\nto-day, and that at all costs it must not \
reach him.  [_Goes to the\\ndoor_, _and opens it_.]  Oh! Robert is coming \
upstairs with the letter in\\nhis hand.  It has reached him \
already.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_With a cry of pain_.]  Oh! you have saved his \
life;\\nwhat have you done with mine?\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  _He \
has the letter in his hand_, _and is\\nreading it_.  _He comes towards his \
wife_, _not noticing_ LORD GORING\[CloseCurlyQuote]S\\n_presence_.]\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  \[OpenCurlyQuote]I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to \
you.\\nGertrude.\[CloseCurlyQuote]  Oh, my love!  Is this true?  Do you \
indeed trust me, and want\\nme?  If so, it was for me to come to you, not for \
you to write of coming\\nto me.  This letter of yours, Gertrude, makes me \
feel that nothing that\\nthe world may do can hurt me now.  You want me, \
Gertrude?\\n\\n[LORD GORING, _unseen by_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN, _makes an \
imploring sign\\nto_ LADY CHILTERN _to accept the situation and_ SIR ROBERT\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]S _error_.]\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Yes.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  You trust me, Gertrude?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Yes.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  Ah! why did you not add you loved me?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  \
[_Taking his hand_.]  Because I loved you.\\n\\n[LORD GORING _passes into the \
conservatory_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Kisses her_.]  Gertrude, you don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know what I\\nfeel.  When Montford passed me your letter \
across the table\[LongDash]he had opened\\nit by mistake, I suppose, without \
looking at the handwriting on the\\nenvelope\[LongDash]and I read it\
\[LongDash]oh! I did not care what disgrace or punishment was\\nin store for \
me, I only thought you loved me still.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  There is no \
disgrace in store for you, nor any public\\nshame.  Mrs. Cheveley has handed \
over to Lord Goring the document that\\nwas in her possession, and he has \
destroyed it.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Are you sure of this, \
Gertrude?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Yes; Lord Goring has just told me.\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  Then I am safe!  Oh! what a wonderful thing to be\\nsafe!  \
For two days I have been in terror.  I am safe now.  How did\\nArthur destroy \
my letter?  Tell me.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  He burned it.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  I wish I had seen that one sin of my youth burning\\nto ashes.  \
How many men there are in modern life who would like to see\\ntheir past \
burning to white ashes before them!  Is Arthur still here?\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  Yes; he is in the conservatory.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am so \
glad now I made that speech last night in\\nthe House, so glad.  I made it \
thinking that public disgrace might be the\\nresult.  But it has not been so.\
\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Public honour has been the result.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  I think so.  I fear so, almost.  For although I am\\nsafe from \
detection, although every proof against me is destroyed, I\\nsuppose, \
Gertrude . . . I suppose I should retire from public life?  [_He\\nlooks \
anxiously at his wife_.]\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Eagerly_.]  Oh yes, Robert, \
you should do that.  It is\\nyour duty to do that.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
It is much to surrender.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  No; it will be much to gain.\\n\
\\n[SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _walks up and down the room with a \
troubled\\nexpression_.  _Then comes over to his wife_, _and puts his hand on \
her\\nshoulder_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And you would be happy living \
somewhere alone with\\nme, abroad perhaps, or in the country away from \
London, away from public\\nlife?  You would have no regrets?\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  Oh! none, Robert.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Sadly_.]  And your \
ambition for me?  You used to\\nbe ambitious for me.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Oh, \
my ambition!  I have none now, but that we two may\\nlove each other.  It was \
your ambition that led you astray.  Let us not\\ntalk about \
ambition.\\n\\n[LORD GORING _returns from the conservatory_, _looking very \
pleased with\\nhimself_, _and with an entirely new buttonhole that some one \
has made for\\nhim_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Going towards him_.]  \
Arthur, I have to thank you\\nfor what you have done for me.  I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know how I can repay you.\\n[_Shakes hands with him_.]\\n\
\\nLORD GORING.  My dear fellow, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll tell you at once.  At \
the present\\nmoment, under the usual palm tree . . . I mean in the \
conservatory . . .\\n\\n[_Enter_ MASON.]\\n\\nMASON.  Lord \
Caversham.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  That admirable father of mine really makes a \
habit of\\nturning up at the wrong moment.  It is very heartless of him, very\
\\nheartless indeed.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.  MASON _goes \
out_.]\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Good morning, Lady Chiltern!  Warmest \
congratulations to\\nyou, Chiltern, on your brilliant speech last night.  I \
have just left the\\nPrime Minister, and you are to have the vacant seat in \
the Cabinet.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With a look of joy and triumph_.]  \
A seat in the\\nCabinet?\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Yes; here is the Prime \
Minister\[CloseCurlyQuote]s letter.  [_Hands\\nletter_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  [_Takes letter and reads it_.]  A seat in the\\nCabinet!\\n\\nLORD \
CAVERSHAM.  Certainly, and you well deserve it too.  You have got\\nwhat we \
want so much in political life nowadays\[LongDash]high character, \
high\\nmoral tone, high principles.  [_To_ LORD GORING.]  Everything that you\
\\nhave not got, sir, and never will have.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like principles, father.  I prefer prejudices.\\n\\n[SIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN _is on the brink of accepting the Prime Minister\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\noffer_, _when he sees wife looking at him with her \
clear_, _candid eyes_.\\n_He then realises that it is impossible_.]\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  I cannot accept this offer, Lord Caversham.  I have\\nmade \
up my mind to decline it.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Decline it, sir!\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  My intention is to retire at once from public \
life.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Angrily_.]  Decline a seat in the Cabinet, and \
retire\\nfrom public life?  Never heard such damned nonsense in the whole \
course\\nof my existence.  I beg your pardon, Lady Chiltern.  Chiltern, I beg \
your\\npardon.  [_To_ LORD GORING.]  Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t grin like that, \
sir.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  No, father.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Lady Chiltern, you \
are a sensible woman, the most\\nsensible woman in London, the most sensible \
woman I know.  Will you\\nkindly prevent your husband from making such a . . \
. from taking such\\n. . . Will you kindly do that, Lady Chiltern?\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  I think my husband in right in his determination, \
Lord\\nCaversham.  I approve of it.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  You approve of it?  \
Good heavens!\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Taking her husband\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
hand_.]  I admire him for it.  I\\nadmire him immensely for it.  I have never \
admired him so much before.\\nHe is finer than even I thought him.  [_To_ SIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.]  You\\nwill go and write your letter to the Prime Minister \
now, won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you?\\nDon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t hesitate about it, \
Robert.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With a touch of bitterness_.]  I suppose \
I had\\nbetter write it at once.  Such offers are not repeated.  I will ask \
you\\nto excuse me for a moment, Lord Caversham.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I may \
come with you, Robert, may I not?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes, \
Gertrude.\\n\\n[LADY CHILTERN _goes out with him_.]\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  \
What is the matter with this family?  Something wrong\\nhere, eh?  [_Tapping \
his forehead_.]  Idiocy?  Hereditary, I suppose.\\nBoth of them, too.  Wife \
as well as husband.  Very sad.  Very sad indeed!\\nAnd they are not an old \
family.  Can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t understand it.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  It is not \
idiocy, father, I assure you.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  What is it then, \
sir?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_After some hesitation_.]  Well, it is what is \
called\\nnowadays a high moral tone, father.  That is all.\\n\\nLORD \
CAVERSHAM.  Hate these new-fangled names.  Same thing as we used to\\ncall \
idiocy fifty years ago.  Shan\[CloseCurlyQuote]t stay in this house any \
longer.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Taking his arm_.]  Oh! just go in here for a \
moment,\\nfather.  Third palm tree to the left, the usual palm \
tree.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  What, sir?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I beg your pardon, \
father, I forgot.  The conservatory,\\nfather, the \
conservatory\[LongDash]there is some one there I want you to talk \
to.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  What about, sir?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  About me, \
father,\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Grimly_.]  Not a subject on which much \
eloquence is\\npossible.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  No, father; but the lady is like \
me.  She doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t care much\\nfor eloquence in others.  She \
thinks it a little loud.\\n\\n[LORD CAVERSHAM _goes out into the \
conservatory_.  LADY CHILTERN\\n_enters_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern, \
why are you playing Mrs. Cheveley\[CloseCurlyQuote]s cards?\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  [_Startled_.]  I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t understand you.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Mrs. Cheveley made an attempt to ruin your husband.  Either\\nto \
drive him from public life, or to make him adopt a dishonourable\\nposition.  \
From the latter tragedy you saved him.  The former you are now\\nthrusting on \
him.  Why should you do him the wrong Mrs. Cheveley tried to\\ndo and failed?\
\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Lord Goring?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_Pulling himself \
together for a great effort_, _and\\nshowing the philosopher that underlies \
the dandy_.]  Lady Chiltern, allow\\nme.  You wrote me a letter last night in \
which you said you trusted me\\nand wanted my help.  Now is the moment when \
you really want my help, now\\nis the time when you have got to trust me, to \
trust in my counsel and\\njudgment.  You love Robert.  Do you want to kill \
his love for you?  What\\nsort of existence will he have if you rob him of \
the fruits of his\\nambition, if you take him from the splendour of a great \
political career,\\nif you close the doors of public life against him, if you \
condemn him to\\nsterile failure, he who was made for triumph and success?  \
Women are not\\nmeant to judge us, but to forgive us when we need \
forgiveness.  Pardon,\\nnot punishment, is their mission.  Why should you \
scourge him with rods\\nfor a sin done in his youth, before he knew you, \
before he knew himself?\\nA man\[CloseCurlyQuote]s life is of more value than \
a woman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s.  It has larger issues,\\nwider scope, greater \
ambitions.  A woman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s life revolves in curves of\\nemotions. \
 It is upon lines of intellect that a man\[CloseCurlyQuote]s life progresses.\
\\nDon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t make any terrible mistake, Lady Chiltern.  A woman \
who can keep a\\nman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s love, and love him in return, has \
done all the world wants of\\nwomen, or should want of them.\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  [_Troubled and hesitating_.]  But it is my husband\\nhimself who \
wishes to retire from public life.  He feels it is his duty.\\nIt was he who \
first said so.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Rather than lose your love, Robert would do \
anything, wreck\\nhis whole career, as he is on the brink of doing now.  He \
is making for\\nyou a terrible sacrifice.  Take my advice, Lady Chiltern, and \
do not\\naccept a sacrifice so great.  If you do, you will live to repent \
it\\nbitterly.  We men and women are not made to accept such sacrifices \
from\\neach other.  We are not worthy of them.  Besides, Robert has \
been\\npunished enough.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  We have both been punished.  I \
set him up too high.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  [_With deep feeling in his voice_.]  \
Do not for that reason\\nset him down now too low.  If he has fallen from his \
altar, do not thrust\\nhim into the mire.  Failure to Robert would be the \
very mire of shame.\\nPower is his passion.  He would lose everything, even \
his power to feel\\nlove.  Your husband\[CloseCurlyQuote]s life is at this \
moment in your hands, your\\nhusband\[CloseCurlyQuote]s love is in your \
hands.  Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mar both for him.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude, here is the draft of my \
letter.  Shall I\\nread it to you?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Let me see \
it.\\n\\n[SIR ROBERT _hands her the letter_.  _She reads it_, _and then_, \
_with a\\ngesture of passion_, _tears it up_.]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \
What are you doing?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  A man\[CloseCurlyQuote]s life is of \
more value than a woman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s.  It has\\nlarger issues, wider \
scope, greater ambitions.  Our lives revolve in\\ncurves of emotions.  It is \
upon lines of intellect that a man\[CloseCurlyQuote]s life\\nprogresses.  I \
have just learnt this, and much else with it, from Lord\\nGoring.  And I will \
not spoil your life for you, nor see you spoil it as\\na sacrifice to me, a \
useless sacrifice!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude!  Gertrude!\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  You can forget.  Men easily forget.  And I forgive.  That\\nis how \
women help the world.  I see that now.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Deeply \
overcome by emotion_, _embraces her_.]  My\\nwife! my wife!  [_To_ LORD \
GORING.]  Arthur, it seems that I am always to\\nbe in your debt.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Oh dear no, Robert.  Your debt is to Lady Chiltern, not \
to\\nme!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I owe you much.  And now tell me what you \
were\\ngoing to ask me just now as Lord Caversham came in.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
Robert, you are your sister\[CloseCurlyQuote]s guardian, and I want \
your\\nconsent to my marriage with her.  That is all.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  \
Oh, I am so glad!  I am so glad!  [_Shakes hands with_\\nLORD \
GORING.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Thank you, Lady Chiltern.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  [_With a troubled look_.]  My sister to be your\\nwife?\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Yes.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Speaking with great firmness_.]  \
Arthur, I am\\nvery sorry, but the thing is quite out of the question.  I \
have to think\\nof Mabel\[CloseCurlyQuote]s future happiness.  And I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think her happiness would be\\nsafe in your hands.  And I \
cannot have her sacrificed!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Sacrificed!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  Yes, utterly sacrificed.  Loveless marriages are\\nhorrible.  But \
there is one thing worse than an absolutely loveless\\nmarriage.  A marriage \
in which there is love, but on one side only;\\nfaith, but on one side only; \
devotion, but on one side only, and in which\\nof the two hearts one is sure \
to be broken.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  But I love Mabel.  No other woman has any \
place in my life.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Robert, if they love each other, why \
should they not be\\nmarried?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Arthur cannot bring \
Mabel the love that she\\ndeserves.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  What reason have you \
for saying that?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_After a pause_.]  Do you really \
require me to\\ntell you?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Certainly I do.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT \
CHILTERN.  As you choose.  When I called on you yesterday\\nevening I found \
Mrs. Cheveley concealed in your rooms.  It was between\\nten and eleven o\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock at night.  I do not wish to say anything more.\\nYour \
relations with Mrs. Cheveley have, as I said to you last night,\\nnothing \
whatsoever to do with me.  I know you were engaged to be married\\nto her \
once.  The fascination she exercised over you then seems to have\\nreturned.  \
You spoke to me last night of her as of a woman pure and\\nstainless, a woman \
whom you respected and honoured.  That may be so.  But\\nI cannot give my \
sister\[CloseCurlyQuote]s life into your hands.  It would be wrong of \
me.\\nIt would be unjust, infamously unjust to her.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I have \
nothing more to say.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  Robert, it was not Mrs. Cheveley \
whom Lord Goring\\nexpected last night.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Not Mrs. \
Cheveley!  Who was it then?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern!\\n\\nLADY \
CHILTERN.  It was your own wife.  Robert, yesterday afternoon Lord\\nGoring \
told me that if ever I was in trouble I could come to him for\\nhelp, as he \
was our oldest and best friend.  Later on, after that\\nterrible scene in \
this room, I wrote to him telling him that I trusted\\nhim, that I had need \
of him, that I was coming to him for help and\\nadvice.  [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN \
_takes the letter out of his pocket_.]\\nYes, that letter.  I didn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t go to Lord Goring\[CloseCurlyQuote]s, after all.  I felt \
that\\nit is from ourselves alone that help can come.  Pride made me think \
that.\\nMrs. Cheveley went.  She stole my letter and sent it anonymously to \
you\\nthis morning, that you should think . . . Oh! Robert, I cannot tell you\
\\nwhat she wished you to think. . . .\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What!  Had \
I fallen so low in your eyes that you\\nthought that even for a moment I \
could have doubted your goodness?\\nGertrude, Gertrude, you are to me the \
white image of all good things, and\\nsin can never touch you.  Arthur, you \
can go to Mabel, and you have my\\nbest wishes!  Oh! stop a moment.  There is \
no name at the beginning of\\nthis letter.  The brilliant Mrs. Cheveley does \
not seem to have noticed\\nthat.  There should be a name.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN. \
 Let me write yours.  It is you I trust and need.  You and\\nnone \
else.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Well, really, Lady Chiltern, I think I should have \
back my\\nown letter.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Smiling_.]  No; you shall have \
Mabel.  [_Takes the\\nletter and writes her husband\[CloseCurlyQuote]s name \
on it_.]\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Well, I hope she hasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t changed \
her mind.  It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s nearly\\ntwenty minutes since I saw her \
last.\\n\\n[_Enter_ MABEL CHILTERN _and_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]\\n\\nMABEL \
CHILTERN.  Lord Goring, I think your father\[CloseCurlyQuote]s conversation \
much\\nmore improving than yours.  I am only going to talk to Lord Caversham \
in\\nthe future, and always under the usual palm tree.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \
Darling!  [_Kisses her_.]\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Considerably taken aback_.] \
 What does this mean, sir?\\nYou don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mean to say that this \
charming, clever young lady has been so\\nfoolish as to accept you?\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Certainly, father!  And Chiltern\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been wise enough \
to\\naccept the seat in the Cabinet.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  I am very glad to \
hear that, Chiltern . . . I\\ncongratulate you, sir.  If the country doesn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t go to the dogs or the\\nRadicals, we shall have you Prime \
Minister, some day.\\n\\n[_Enter_ MASON.]\\n\\nMASON.  Luncheon is on the \
table, my Lady!\\n\\n[MASON _goes out_.]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  You\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll stop to luncheon, Lord Caversham, won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
you?\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  With pleasure, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll drive you \
down to Downing Street\\nafterwards, Chiltern.  You have a great future \
before you, a great\\nfuture.  Wish I could say the same for you, sir.  [_To_ \
LORD GORING.]\\nBut your career will have to be entirely domestic.\\n\\nLORD \
GORING.  Yes, father, I prefer it domestic.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  And if you \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t make this young lady an ideal husband,\\nI\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll cut you off with a shilling.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  An \
ideal husband!  Oh, I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think I should like that.\\nIt \
sounds like something in the next world.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  What do you \
want him to be then, dear?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  He can be what he chooses.  \
All I want is to be . . . to\\nbe . . . oh! a real wife to him.\\n\\nLORD \
CAVERSHAM.  Upon my word, there is a good deal of common sense in\\nthat, \
Lady Chiltern.\\n\\n[_They all go out except_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  _He sinks \
in a chair_,\\n_wrapt in thought_.  _After a little time_ LADY CHILTERN \
_returns to look\\nfor him_.]\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Leaning over the back of \
the chair_.]  Aren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you\\ncoming in, Robert?\\n\\nSIR \
ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Taking her hand_.]  Gertrude, is it love you feel\\nfor \
me, or is it pity merely?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  [_Kisses him_.]  It is love, \
Robert.  Love, and only\\nlove.  For both of us a new life is \
beginning.\\n\\n                                 CURTAIN\\n\\n                \

Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free \
distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety \
of computers\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It \
exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations \
from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to \
provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching \
Project Gutenberg-tm's\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm \
collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, \
the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a \
secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future \
generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive \
Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and \
4\\nand the Foundation web page at \
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.  Information \
about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\nFoundation\\n\\nThe Project \
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational \
corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and \
granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service.  The \
Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  \
Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax \
deductible to the full extent\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your \
state's laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan \
Dr. S.\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are \
scattered\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\
\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, \
email\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date \
contact\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and \
official\\npage at http://www.gutenberg.org/about/contact\\n\\nFor additional \
contact information:\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n     Chief Executive and \
Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about \
Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject \
Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public \
support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of \
public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine \
readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including \
outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly \
important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe \
Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and \
charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance \
requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much \
paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do \
not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written \
confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of \
compliance for any\\nparticular state visit \
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not \
solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation \
requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited \
donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\
\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot \
make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received \
from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small \
staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\
\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways \
including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, \
please visit:\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\\n\\n\\nSection \
5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm \
electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the \
Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be \
freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed \
Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\
\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several \
printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the \
U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not \
necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\
\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search \
facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes \
information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to \
the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our \
new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new \
eBooks.\\n\"\>"], "Output",
